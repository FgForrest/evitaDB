/**
 * This implementation of the publisher is used to read mutations from the database and publish them to subscribers.
 * It works in two distinct modes (hence two constructors):
 *
 * 1. Lagging mode - the publisher reads all mutations from the database and publishes them to a single subscriber
 * as long as the subscriber is able to consume them. The publisher will stop reading when the subscriber is saturated.
 * When the subscriber frees its buffer, it must call {@link #readAll()} to continue reading.
 * 2. Tracking mode - the publisher reads all mutations and follows the current catalog version in the system. Mutations
 * are published to all subscribers that can keep up. When the subscriber can't keep up - it's subscription is canceled
 * and the subscriber is discarded using `discardOnLagging` lambda (management system should provision separate
 * MutationReaderPublisher in lagging mode for such subscriber). The publisher in this tracking mode needs to be notified
 * about new catalog version available in the system by calling {@link #readAll()} method.
