/**
 * A shared publisher implementation for Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality that efficiently distributes
 * catalog change events to multiple subscribers. This class implements the reactive streams pattern through
 * the {@link Flow.Publisher} interface.
 *
 * The publisher maintains a ring buffer of recent changes in memory for efficient access and falls back to
 * reading from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) when requested changes are no longer in the buffer. It uses a shared
 * predicate to filter mutations that are relevant to the subscribers based on the provided criteria.
 *
 * This implementation optimizes memory usage by tracking the number of subscribers for each catalog version,
 * allowing it to clean up data that is no longer needed. It also provides thread-safe access to the change
 * catalog captures.
