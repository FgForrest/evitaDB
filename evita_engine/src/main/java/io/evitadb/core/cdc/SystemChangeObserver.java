/**
 * The `SystemChangeObserver` is responsible for capturing and distributing system-level changes
 * within the evitaDB engine. It acts as a central hub for Change Data Capture (CDC) operations
 * at the system level.
 *
 * This class implements the `ChangeObserverContract` interface for system-level changes, handling:
 *
 * - Processing of engine mutations
 * - Registration and management of change capture publishers
 * - Distribution of change events to subscribers
 * - Maintenance of subscriber connections
 *
 * The observer uses a shared publisher model where a single `ChangeSystemCaptureSharedPublisher`
 * processes all mutations, and individual publishers are created for each subscriber with their
 * specific filtering criteria. This approach optimizes resource usage while allowing for
 * customized event delivery.
 *
 * The class also provides mechanisms for:
 * - Notifying when versions are available in the live view
 * - Cleaning up inactive subscribers
 * - Collecting and emitting performance statistics
 * - Managing memory usage by forgetting processed mutations
