/**
 * Implementation of {@link Flow.Subscription} that manages the subscription between a publisher and a subscriber
 * in the Change Data Capture (CDC) system. This class is responsible for handling the flow control (backpressure)
 * by tracking requested items and filling a queue with catalog changes.
 *
 * The subscription maintains a buffer of {@link ChangeCatalogCapture} events and delivers them to the subscriber
 * based on demand. It tracks the last processed version and index to ensure continuity of the event stream.
 *
 * This class implements the reactive streams specification and provides mechanisms for:
 * - Flow control (backpressure) through the request mechanism
 * - Asynchronous processing of catalog change events
 * - Error handling and propagation
 * - Subscription lifecycle management (cancellation, completion)
