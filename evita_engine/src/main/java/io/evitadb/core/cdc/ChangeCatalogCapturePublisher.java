/**
 * Implementation of the {@link Flow.Publisher} interface that publishes {@link ChangeCatalogCapture} events
 * to subscribers. This publisher acts as a facade for the {@link ChangeCatalogCaptureSharedPublisher} and
 * is responsible for handling a specific {@link ChangeCatalogCaptureRequest}.
 *
 * When a subscriber subscribes to this publisher, it delegates the subscription to the shared publisher
 * with the appropriate configuration derived from the request. The publisher determines the starting point
 * for capturing changes based on the request parameters (sinceVersion and sinceIndex) and the requested
 * content.
 *
 * If the request doesn't specify a version to start from, the publisher will use the current catalog
 * version + 1, meaning it will capture changes starting from the next version. If the request doesn't
 * specify an index, it will start from index 0 within the specified version.
