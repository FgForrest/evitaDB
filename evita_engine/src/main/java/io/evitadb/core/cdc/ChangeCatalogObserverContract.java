/**
 * This interface defines a specialized contract for observing and capturing changes specific to catalogs in the evitaDB system.
 * It extends the base {@link ChangeObserverContract} with functionality tailored for handling catalog-bound mutations.
 *
 * The ChangeCatalogObserverContract is responsible for:
 *
 * - Tracking and capturing mutations that are bound to specific catalogs
 * - Managing the lifecycle of catalog-specific change data
 * - Providing mechanisms to handle error recovery scenarios in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) processing
 * - Discarding mutations that relate to older catalog versions and freeing up resources
 *
 * This contract plays a crucial role in maintaining data consistency across distributed systems by ensuring
 * that catalog changes are properly tracked, captured, and can be reliably processed even in failure scenarios.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface should ensure thread safety and proper handling of concurrent access
 * to catalog mutation data.
