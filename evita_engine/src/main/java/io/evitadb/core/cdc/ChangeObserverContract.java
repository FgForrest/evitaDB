/**
 * This interface defines a contract for observing and capturing changes to a catalog in the evitaDB system.
 * It provides mechanisms for tracking mutations, managing catalog change data capture (CDC), and publishing
 * these changes to registered observers.
 *
 * <p>The contract supports the Change Data Capture pattern, allowing clients to subscribe to and receive
 * notifications about changes occurring in the catalog. This is particularly useful for maintaining
 * data consistency across distributed systems, implementing event-driven architectures, and enabling
 * real-time data synchronization.</p>
 *
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tracking persistent state changes in the live view</li>
 *   <li>Processing and capturing mutations from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL)</li>
 *   <li>Managing observer registrations and subscriptions</li>
 *   <li>Publishing captured changes to interested subscribers</li>
 *   <li>Handling error scenarios and recovery mechanisms</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The interface provides a NOOP implementation that can be used when change data capture
 * functionality is not required or not enabled in the configuration.
