/**
 * A ring buffer implementation for storing and retrieving {@link ChangeCatalogCapture} objects.
 * This buffer maintains a fixed-size circular array of catalog change captures, automatically
 * discarding the oldest entries when the buffer becomes full.
 *
 * The buffer tracks the effective start and end versions of the catalog changes it contains,
 * allowing clients to query for changes starting from a specific version and index position.
 * When the buffer is full and new items are added, the oldest items are removed, and the
 * effective start version and index are updated accordingly.
 *
 * This implementation uses a {@link ReentrantLock} to ensure thread safety for reading operations.
 * However, writing operations must always be performed from the same thread to maintain consistency.
 *
 * Class is thread safe for reading, but not thread safe for writing (writing must be always done from the same thread).
