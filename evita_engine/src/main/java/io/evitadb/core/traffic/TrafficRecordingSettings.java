/**
 * TrafficRecordingSettings class encapsulates configuration settings for traffic recording.
 * It defines the parameters that control how traffic data is recorded, including sampling rate,
 * duration, size limits, and chunk file sizes.
 *
 * @param catalogName			   Specifies the name of the catalog for which traffic recording is done.
 * @param samplingRate              Defines the rate at which traffic samples are recorded. The value
 *                                  is provided as a percentage (e.g., 1 to 100), where 100 represents
 *                                  all traffic being recorded and lower values represent partial sampling.
 * @param exportFile				Specifies whether recorded traffic data should be exported to a file.
 * @param recordingDuration         Specifies the duration for which traffic recording should occur.
 *                                  Can be null, indicating that recording is not time-bound. When
 *                                  provided, it ensures that traffic recording will not exceed
 *                                  the defined duration.
 * @param recordingSizeLimitInBytes Specifies the maximum size of the traffic recording in bytes.
 *                                  This parameter is optional and can be null. When provided,
 *                                  it serves as an upper limit for traffic recording size, ensuring
 *                                  that recorded data does not exceed the specified size.
 * @param chunkFileSizeInBytes      Defines the size of each chunk file used to store recorded traffic
 *                                  data. Recorded data is divided into files of this size, aiding in
 *                                  data management and processing efficiency.
