/**
 * Formula is an atomic computational step that allows to compute result of the input {@link io.evitadb.api.query.Query}.
 * Dedicated {@link FilteringConstraintTranslator translators} generate set
 * of computational steps that lead to computation of correct response for the query.
 *
 * Formulas are composed in hierarchical tree that you can imagine as mathematical formula where parentheses represent
 * a tree node with child formulas within.
 *
 * Formula {@link #compute()} produces the result of the equation. Formula can estimate its computational cost by
 * calling {@link #getEstimatedCost()} or more exactly by calling {@link #getCost()} that involves result computation.
 * There costs are derived from {@link #getOperationCost()} that was measured by performance tests on random numbers
 * and the amount of data processed by the formula.
