/**
 * This simple DTO object encapsulates set of {@link TargetIndexes} and information whether additional filtering
 * query that implements {@link IndexUsingConstraint} is used in the input query.
 *
 * @param targetIndexes                        Collection contains all alternative {@link TargetIndexes} sets that might already contain precalculated information
 *                                             related to {@link EntityIndex} that can be used to partially resolve input filter although the target index set
 *                                             is not used to resolve entire query filter.
 * @param targetIndexQueriedByOtherConstraints Field is set to TRUE when it's already known that filtering query contains query that uses data from
 *                                             the index - i.e. query implementing {@link IndexUsingConstraint}. This situation allows
 *                                             certain translators to entirely skip themselves because the query will be implicitly evaluated by the other
 *                                             constraints using already limited subset from the entity index.
