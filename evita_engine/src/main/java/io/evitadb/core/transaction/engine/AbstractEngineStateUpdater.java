/**
 * Convenience base class for {@link EngineStateUpdater} implementations that only need to carry
 * the transaction and mutation metadata. Subclasses are expected to implement the
 * {@link java.util.function.UnaryOperator#apply(Object)} method to compute the next
 * {@link io.evitadb.core.ExpandedEngineState}.
 *
 * The stored metadata is consumed by
 * {@link io.evitadb.core.transaction.engine.EngineTransactionManager} in the post-mutation phase to
 * append the WAL entry, notify observers and persist the new engine state.
 *
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe; fields are final and exposed via getters.
