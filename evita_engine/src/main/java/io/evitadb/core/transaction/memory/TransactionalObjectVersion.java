/**
 * This class allows generating sequence of unique transactional object versions in a thread safe manner. Versions
 * are unique only in single JVM instance and might be reused between JVM instance restarts.
 *
 * There is very little chance of potential issue when the sequence will overflow and start from the beginning. In such
 * a case we might have two different objects with the same version if one is very old (non-changed for a long time) and
 * another is very new. Transactional ids are used for calculation cache hash and the returned results might be wrong.
 *
 * If we detect overflow situation we stop providing new ids and throw exception - this will effectively stop
 * the database from accepting new updates.
