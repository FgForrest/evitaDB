/**
 * EngineTransactionManager coordinates execution of engine-level mutations that change global
 * EvitaDB engine state (e.g. creating, duplicating, modifying, restoring or removing catalogs).
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Serialize updates to the engine state using a reentrant lock, while still allowing
 *   multiple non-conflicting engine mutations to proceed in parallel. The parallelism is
 *   guarded by conflict keys reported by the individual mutations. When a conflict is detected,
 *   a {@link io.evitadb.api.exception.ConflictingEngineMutationException} is thrown.
 * - Provide progress tracking for long-running top-level catalog mutations via {@link Progress}.
 * - Persist committed mutations to the engine Write-Ahead Log (WAL) in the order they finish,
 *   not the order they started, improving resiliency and restart semantics.
 * - Keep the authoritative engine state in sync with the persistence layer and notify
 *   the {@link SystemChangeObserver} about newly committed versions.
 * - Expose a system {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} for asynchronous engine-level tasks
 *   that should not time out.
 *
 * Concurrency and WAL notes:
 * - Before a mutation is executed, its conflict keys are recorded so that subsequent mutations can
 *   detect conflicts early. The keys are removed when the mutation completes.
 * - The engine state is updated in two steps: a pre-mutation update (in-memory) and a post-mutation
 *   update (persisting WAL and the new engine state, then publishing the new version to observers).
 * - WAL is truncated on startup if the previous run left unfinished records.
 *
 * Usage outline:
 * - Call {@link #applyMutation(EngineMutation, java.util.function.IntConsumer)} to run a mutation
 *   and obtain a {@link Progress} handle to observe completion.
 * - Use {@link #getCommittedMutationStream(long)} or
 *   {@link #getReversedCommittedMutationStream(Long)} to iterate through committed WAL entries.
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 * - All state transitions are protected by an internal lock. The lock acquisition respects the
 *   configured transaction timeout and throws {@link TransactionTimedOutException} if it cannot be
 *   obtained in time.
 *
 * This class is closeable and ensures the underlying persistence service is closed on shutdown.
