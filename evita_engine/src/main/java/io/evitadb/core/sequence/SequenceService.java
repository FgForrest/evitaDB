/**
 * Sequence service is a "singleton" service that provide access to the "current sequences" for assigning new primary
 * keys. Sequences must shared among all instances of {@link EntityCollection} that may exist in parallel (for example
 * there are two simultaneous transactions that alter data of the same collection - either of them can commit or rollback
 * but the primary keys might be already returned to the client).
 *
 * Primary keys returned from sequences don't comply to isolation in ACID sense - and this is same even for standard
 * relational databases - see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html">PostgreSQL</a>
 * or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2095917/sequences-not-affected-by-transactions">StackOverflow</a>.
 *
 * Sequences are always monotonic and there may be gaps in them when transactions that requested certain primary keys
 * were rolled back.
