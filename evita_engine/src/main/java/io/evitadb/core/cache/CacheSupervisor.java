/**
 * Formula supervisor is an entry point to the Evita cache. The idea is that each {@link Formula} can be identified by
 * its {@link Formula#computeHash(LongHashFunction)} method and when the supervisor identifies that certain formula is frequently used
 * in query formulas it moves its memoized results to the cache. The non-computed formula of the same hash will be
 * exchanged in next query that contains it with the cached formula that already contains memoized result.
 *
 * The key aspect of each caching mechanism is invalidation when the cached data become obsolete. We keep all
 * {@link Formula#gatherTransactionalIds() transactional bitmap ids} the formula builds upon along with the cached
 * formula. When the underlying datastore is changed we can track which bitmaps were discarded and mark all cached
 * formulas that refer to any of those discarded bitmaps as obsolete. We update the cached formula with the last
 * transaction id they're valid to (we keep also the transaction id when the formula result was memoized) when they
 * link to the discarded bitmap.
 *
 * If we found formula in cache we compare its transaction id validity span (from-to) with the transaction id of the
 * {@link EvitaSessionContract} the query is executed in. The cached formula result is used only when the transaction id is
 * within the memoized formula validity span. By this mechanism we may still keep obsolete results in a cache for a while
 * providing there are old Evita sessions that heavily work with these. If not the formulas will quickly fade away
 * through "cooling" mechanism and get evicted from the cache.
