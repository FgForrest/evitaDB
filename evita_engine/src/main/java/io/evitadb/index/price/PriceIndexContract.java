/**
 * PriceIndexContract describes the API of {@link PriceIndexContract} that maintains data structures for fast
 * accessing entity prices. Interface describes both read and write access to the index.
 *
 * Purpose of this contract interface is to ease using {@link @lombok.experimental.Delegate} annotation
 * in {@link io.evitadb.index.EntityIndex} and minimize the amount of the code in this complex class by automatically
 * delegating all {@link PriceIndexContract} methods to the {@link PriceIndexContract} implementation that is part
 * of this index.
