/**
 * A record that associates a transaction mutation and its corresponding engine mutation with their location
 * in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) file system.
 *
 * This class serves as an extended container that holds both a transaction mutation, its associated engine mutation,
 * and a reference to where they're stored in the WAL, allowing the system to track and retrieve both mutations
 * efficiently. It's primarily used when appending transaction mutations along with their engine mutations to the WAL
 * in the persistence service.
 *
 * The class contains three components:
 * - `walFileReference`: A reference to the WAL file where the mutations are stored
 * - `transactionMutation`: The transaction mutation itself, containing information about the transaction
 * - `engineMutation`: The corresponding engine mutation that implements the actual changes
