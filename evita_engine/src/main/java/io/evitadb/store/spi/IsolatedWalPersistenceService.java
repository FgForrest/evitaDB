/**
 * The {@code IsolatedWalPersistenceService} interface represents a service for persisting mutations using Write-Ahead
 * Logging (WAL).  It provides methods for writing mutations to the WAL, retrieving metadata about the WAL, and
 * obtaining a reference to the WAL data. It bears the name "isolated" because it is intended to store WAL records
 * for multiple parallel transactions at the same time. Instance of this service are created and held by the
 * {@link TransactionContract} implementation but need to write to a separate WAL files.
 *
 * The service also implements the {@code Closeable} interface to allow for proper resource cleanup.
