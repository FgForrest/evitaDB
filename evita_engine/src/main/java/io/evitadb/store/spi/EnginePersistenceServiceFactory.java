/**
 * This interface and layer of abstraction was introduced because we want to split data storage / serialization and
 * the evitaDB implementation into separate modules, and we need to avoid circular dependency. The data storage
 * refers to the evitaDB business objects, but also evitaDB needs to call persistence logic via. defined interfaces.
 * Therefore, we used {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} pattern to dynamically locate proper but single implementation
 * of this interface and link these modules in runtime.
 *
 * The reasons for splitting evitaDB into main and storage module include:
 *
 * - we don't want to open interfaces of main domain objects such as {@link io.evitadb.api.requestResponse.data.structure.Entity} and
 *   others as public (constructors, fields, methods) in order the standard code don't use them directly - but still we
 *   want (de)serializers in this module to use exclusive internal ways of their instantiation
 *
 *   That's why certain fields / constructors are package protected and the serializer resides in the same package, but
 *   different module. If we wouldn't split the serializers into the different module, the original evitaDB would get
 *   polluted with both serialization and business logic that we want to avoid.
 *
 * - we wanted to also abstract from storage internals so that the business logic of evitaDB is not tightly coupled
 *   with the storage implementation
