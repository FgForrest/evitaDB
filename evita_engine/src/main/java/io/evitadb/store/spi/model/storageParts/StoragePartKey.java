/**
 * StoragePartKey represents a key, that can be any time converted to the {@link StoragePart} that can be stored to
 * persistent data store.
 *
 * Storage keys represents a way how to postpone persistence of frequently modified data structures such as
 * {@link io.evitadb.index.EntityIndex EntityIndexes} so that multiple entities can alter them in a single or multiple
 * serially executed transaction and persist them at the end so that I/O is minimized.
 *
 * @param originalKey    The original key must uniquely identify the record among all other records both of the same type. You need to be able
 *                       to fully compute {@link StoragePart#getStoragePartPK()} based on information stored in this key. The key
 *                       must have proper equals and hashCode implementation and also {@link Comparable} interface is recommended to be
 *                       implemented by the key.
 * @param containerClass The type of the storage part that distinguishes record of this type from other StorageParts.
