/**
 * Marks {@link StoragePart} implementations that represent a portion of an {@link Entity}'s persistent state.
 * An entity is decomposed into several independently stored parts so that queries that request only a subset of
 * entity data (e.g. only prices, only attributes in a specific locale) incur minimal I/O — only the relevant parts
 * need to be loaded.
 *
 * When designing the granularity of entity parts the following trade-offs apply:
 * - parts that are always fetched together should be stored as one part to avoid multiple seeks
 * - very large parts should be stored separately so that unrelated queries don't pay the deserialization cost
 * - very many tiny parts increase the per-record overhead of the offset-index file format
 *
 * Current concrete implementations include `EntityBodyStoragePart`, `AttributesStoragePart`,
 * `AssociatedDataStoragePart`, `ReferencesStoragePart`, and `PricesStoragePart`.
