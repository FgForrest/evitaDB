	 * Suppose for example that you wish to compute the intersection between an ordered list of integers
	 * (e.g., int[] x = {1,4,5}) and a BatchIterator.
	 *
	 * You might do it as follows...
	 * <pre><code>
	 *     int[] buffer = new int[128];
	 *     BatchIterator j = // get an iterator
	 *     int val = // first value from my other data structure
	 *     j.advanceIfNeeded(val);
	 *     while ( j.hasNext() ) {
	 *       int limit = j.nextBatch(buffer);
	 *       for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
	 *         if (buffer[i] == val) {
	 *           // got it!
	 *           // do something here
	 *           val = // get next value?
	 *         }
	 *       }
	 *       j.advanceIfNeeded(val);
	 *     }
	 *     </code></pre>
	 *
	 * The benefit of calling advanceIfNeeded is that each such call can be much faster than repeated calls to "next".
	 * The underlying implementation can "skip" over some data.
	 *
	 * The method copies the approach in `org.roaringbitmap.BatchIterator#advanceIfNeeded(int)`
