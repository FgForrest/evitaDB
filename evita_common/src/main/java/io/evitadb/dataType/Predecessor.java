/**
 * Predecessor is a special data type allowing to create consistent or semi-consistent linked lists in evitaDB and sort
 * by the order of the elements in the list. Predecessor represents a reference to another entity of the same type
 * as itself that is the predecessor of the entity it is attached to.
 *
 * Let's have this ordered sequence of entities: [5, 3, 1, 4]
 * This sequence can be translated to the following Predecessor attributes:
 *
 * Entity PK | Predecessor
 * ------------------------
 * 5         | HEAD (-1)
 * 3		 | 5
 * 1		 | 3
 * 4		 | 1
 *
 * As you can see, the Predecessor uses the primary key of the same entity as a pointer to its predecessor. The only
 * exception is the HEAD entity, which is a special entity representing the beginning of the list.
