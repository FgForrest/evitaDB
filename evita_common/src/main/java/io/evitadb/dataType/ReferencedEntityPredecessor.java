/**
 * ReferencedEntityPredecessor is an opposite of the {@link Predecessor} data type. It is a special data type allowing
 * to create consistent or semi-consistent linked lists in evitaDB and sort by the order of the elements in the list.
 * ReferencedEntityPredecessor can be used only in reference attributes and represents a reference to another entity of
 * the same referenced entity type.
 *
 * Let's have a relation between products and category. Each products can have a reference to a category it belongs to
 * and there is {@link Predecessor} attribute that indicates the order of the products in the category:
 *
 * Product PK | Category FK | Predecessor
 * ---------------------------------------
 * 5          | 1           | HEAD (-1)
 * 3          | 1           | 5
 * 1          | 1           | 3
 * 4          | 1           | 1
 *
 * If the reference is made as bi-directional and we want to view the products from the category perspective including
 * the order of the products, we must use the ReferencedEntityPredecessor attribute:
 *
 * Category PK | Product FK | ReferencedEntityPredecessor
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * 1           | 5          | HEAD (-1)
 * 1           | 3          | 5
 * 1           | 1          | 3
 * 1           | 4          | 1
