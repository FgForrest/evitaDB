	/**
	 * Represents a functional interface that can be used to encapsulate a block of code

	 * form of {@link Runnable} for operations where checked I/O exceptions need to be handled.
	 *
	 * Implementations of this interface enable the execution of operations with the awareness
	 * and explicit handling of {@link IOException}. This is especially useful in scenarios
	 * where multiple such operations need to be executed or wrapped with exception aggregation,
	 * for example, in utility methods like resource handling or cleanup.
	 *
	 * Method {@code run} is similar to the {@link Runnable#run()} method but allows an
	 * {@link IOException} to be thrown.
	 *
	 * Functional-style programming can make use of this interface to define inline behaviors
	 * for operations expected to throw {@link IOException}. It can also be integrated with
	 * various utility methods that leverage this interface for exception handling and resource management.
