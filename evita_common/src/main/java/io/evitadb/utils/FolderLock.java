/**
 * The FolderLock class is used to enforce exclusive access to a specific folder by creating and locking
 * a file in the folder. This is useful for ensuring that only one process can access or manipulate
 * the folder's contents at a time.
 *
 * This class implements the Closeable interface, meaning it should be closed after use to release
 * resources and clean up the lock file. When the lock is acquired, it creates a file named ".lock"
 * in the folder and locks it using a file lock. Attempting to create another FolderLock instance
 * on the same folder while it is already locked will throw a {@link FolderAlreadyUsedException}.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - To ensure exclusive access to a folder, instantiate FolderLock with the desired folder path.
 * - Remember to call the {@code close()} method to properly release the lock and delete the lock file
 * when access to the folder is no longer needed.
