    <h4>Terms used in this document</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>brand</dt>
		<dd>A Brand is an entity that represents the manufacturer or supplier of the product. Brands are often a key factor driving customers'
			choice process. E-commerce sites provide information about the brand in the product detail and very often provide specialized
			brand pages with all products of a brand with additional information about the manufacturing process, quality assurance
			and other marketing information.</dd>
		<dt>cart</dt>
		<dd>A cart is a place where items selected by a customer for later purchase are collected. The cart is an important part of each
			e-commerce application but since it's specific to the e-commerce store, there's no special support in evitaDB.</dd>
		<dt>category</dt>
		<dd>A category is an entity that forms a hierarchical tree and categorizes items on the e-commerce site into a better accessible
			form for the customer. A category in a store with electronic products may be `Computers`, which has sub-categories
			`Laptops`, `Game consoles`, `Desktops` and so on. It is common upper categories on e-commerce sites display items placed
			in all its sub-categories. In our example it means that in the category `Computers`, the customer will see either laptops, game
			consoles or desktops all at once.</dd>
		<dt>complex entities</dt>
		<dd>Complex entities are entities that represent a bulk of other entities. On example is `parametrized product` - i.e. a product
			with several variants when only variant can be bought. A real life example of such parametrized product is a T-shirt that
			has several sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL) and different colors (blue, red). You want the T-shirt to be represented as single
			product in e-commerce listing and variant selection is performed at the moment of the purchase. Different variants of
			this shirt may have different prices so when filtering or sorting we need to select single price that will be used for
			`parametrized product`. For such case FIRST_OCCURRENCE inner entity reference handling strategy is the best fit
			(see [PriceInnerEntityReferenceHandling](classes/price_inner_entity_reference_handling)).			
			A different example of a complex entity is a `product set`. A product set is a product that consists of several sub products, but
			is purchased as a whole. A real life example of such product set is a drawer - it consists of the body, the door and handles.
			The customer could even choose, which type of doors or handles they want in the set - but there always be some defaults. Again,
			we need some price assigned for the product set for the sake of a listing (i.e. filtering and sorting) but there may be none
			when the price is computed as an aggregation of the prices of sub-products. In case this happens, the SUM inner entity
			reference handling strategy is the best fit (see [PriceInnerEntityReferenceHandling](classes/price_inner_entity_reference_handling)).</dd>
		<dt>facet</dt>
		<dd>A facet is a property of the entity that is used for quick filtering entities by the customer. It is represented as a
			checkbox in the filtering bar or as a slider in case of a large number of distinct numeric values. Facets help customers to
			narrow their listing of current category, manufacturer listing or the results of the fulltext search. It would be hard for the
			customer go through dozens of pages of results and probably would be forced to look for some sub-category or find a
			better search phrase. That's frustrating for the user and facets could ease this process. The user can narrow the results
			by a few clicks on relevant facets. The key aspect here is to provide enough information and require to guide user to
			most relevant facet combinations. It's very helpful to disregard facets as soon as they would cause no results to be
			returned or even inform the user that selecting a particular facet would narrow the results to very few records and that their
			freedom of choice will be severely affected.</dd>
		<dt>facet group</dt>
		<dd>A facet group is used to group [facets](terms_explanation#facet) of the same type. Facet groups control the mechanisms of facet
			filtering. It means that facet groups allow defining, whether facets in the group are combined with a boolean OR, AND
			relations when used in filtering. It also allows defining how this facet group will be combined with other facet groups
			in the same query (i.e. AND, OR, NOT). This type of boolean logic affects the statistics computation of the facets and is
			the crucial part of the facet evaluation.</dd>
		<dt>fulltext search</dt>
		<dd>[Fulltext search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search) is a process when user tries to locate an appropriate
			product/category/brand (or any other entity) by specifying a search phrase. The problem is that user expects fulltext
			results to be as accurate as Google provides in its search. Achieving a similar quality in e-commerce application is
			a really hard task that requires both, a top-notch fulltext engine and some form of self-learning algorithms (AI).</dd>
		<dt>group</dt>
		<dd>A group is an entity that references a set of products by some cross-cutting concert. As an example of groups, you can imagine:
			top products (displayed on the homepage), new products (last X products added to an inventory), gifts and so on. Groups are
			versatile units to display a bunch of products on different places of the web application.</dd>
		<dt>product</dt>
		<dd>A product is an entity that represents the item sold at an e-commerce store. The products represent the very core of each e-commerce
			application.</dd>	
		<dt>product with variants</dt>
		<dd>A product with a variant is a "virtual product" that cannot be bought directly. A customer must choose one of its variants
			instead. Products with variants are very often seen in e-commerce fashion stores where clothes come in various sizes
			and colors. A single product can have dozens combinations of size and color. If each combination represented standard
			[product](#product), a product listing in [a category](#category) and other places would become unusable.
			In this situation, products with variants become very handy. This &quot;virtual product&quot; can be listed instead of variants
			and a variant selection is performed at the time of placing the goods into the [cart](#cart). Let's have an example:			
			We have a T-Shirt with a unicorn picture on it. The T-Shirt is produced in different sizes and colors - namely:<br/><br/>
			&ndash; size: S, M, L, XL, XXL<br/>
			&ndash; color: blue, pink, violet<br/><br/>			
			That represents 15 possible combinations (variants). Because we only want a single unicorn T-Shirt in our listings, we
			create a product with variants and enclose all variant combinations to this virtual product.</dd>
		<dt>product set</dt>
		<dd>A product set is a product that consists of several sub products, but is purchased as a whole. A real life example of such
			product set is a drawer - it consists of the body, the door and handles. A customer could even choose which type of doors
			or handles they want in the set - but there always be some defaults.<br/>			
			When displaying and filtering by a product set in the listings on the e-commerce site, we need some price assigned for it
			but there may be a none exact price assigned to the set and the e-commerce owner expects that price would be computed
			as an aggregation of the prices of sub-products. This behaviour is supported by setting proper
			[PriceInnerEntityReferenceHandling](classes/price_inner_entity_reference_handling).</dd>
		<dt>property</dt>
		<dd>An entity that represents an item property. Properties are handled as top entities, because we expect that properties may have
			additional attributes and localizations to different languages. Properties are usually referenced in other items'
			[facets](#facet). Properties are usually composed of two parts:<br/><br/>			
			&ndash; property group, referenced in [facet group](#facet-group), fe. color, size, sex<br/>
			&ndash; property value, referenced in [facet](#facet), fe. blue, XXL, women<br/><br/></dd>
		<dt>variant product</dt>
		<dd>A variant product is a product that is enclosed within a product with variants and represents
			a single combination of a particular product. In case of the example used in a referenced chapter, it would be, for example, 
			the `Unicorn T-Shirt, pink, M size`.</dd>

This document uses the future tense because it was originally written at the beginning of the project. The research
phase of the project has now ended, so the future tense does not make sense now, but we have made only minimal changes
to the text to preserve the original ideas and tone. Notes and references have been added at some points in the document
to refer to a specific part of the research already conducted.

## Research procedure

An API covering the [required functionalities](#query-requirements) will be implemented on top of the two general-purpose 
freely available databases and compared with single "greenfield" solution.

All competing solutions will be populated using a data pump with real datasets (both from B2C and B2B environment)
of existing FG Forrest clients, who gave their explicit consent to do so. The client data sets will not contain any
personal data - it will only represent a "sale catalog".

## Evaluation methodology

A single, automated test suite will be implemented that will test all of the basic scenarios from a real-life e-commerce
solution. This suit will then be run against individual implementations in a lab environment and the results
will be recorded.

The criteria for evaluating the best option are:

- cumulative response speed in the test scenarios (weight 75%)
- memory space consumption (weight 20%)
- disk space consumption (weight 5%)

The cumulative response time to (at least) all subsequent search queries is measured on:

* category tree display (open to the current category) - menu rendering
* category detail display (retrieving one full category entity) + product listing
* product listing filterable by
	* parameters
	* brands
	* tags
	* prices
* product ordering
	* by selected attribute
	* by price

The cache utilization is problematic in a filtering scenario, because there are way too many combinations the user can
select. Moreover, the data is frequently changed due and the impact of these changes, it is hard to translate to cache
record invalidation orders, because of the complex relations between them. The implementations thus can't rely
on the caching layer when the tests are run and the performance is evaluated.

<Note type="info">
The final evaluation of the reseach is [available here](../evaluation/evaluation).

The final datasets were reduced to only Senesi.cz, Signal-nabytek.cz and the new dataset, KeramikaSoukup.cz, was added.
The record cardinalities in some of those datasets were enlarged considerably (see [evaluation results here](../evaluation/evaluation#data)).

</Note>

## Validation set

In the initial phase, the university teams will select one general-purpose relational database and one NoSQL database.
The criteria for selecting a database machine is:

* the license to run the e-commerce platform must be free of charge
* the database resource must have good documentation
* the database is expected to be further developed or supported in the next 5 to 10 years
* it can run on Linux OS (ideally Ubuntu distribution)

Recommended technologies to start investigation are (the selected set is not complete and can be extended by another
database engine):

* relational database candidates:
	* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) ([MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/), [Percona](https://www.percona.com/))
	* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<Note type="info">
The selection process is described [in appendix A](../sql/thesis#appendix-a-postgresql-selection-rationale)
of the associated thesis. The **PostgreSQL** was selected as the platform for prototype implementation on top of
the relational database.
</Note>

* NoSQL database candidates:
	* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
	* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) ([Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/))

<Note type="info">
The selection process is described [in appendix A](../nosql/thesis/thesis#appendix-a-elasticsearch-selection-rationale)
of the associated thesis. **Elasticsearch** was selected as the platform for prototype implementation on top of
the relational database.
</Note>

### Custom "greenfield" solution

The solution will be designed as an in-memory NoSQL database optimized to run on a single machine. The cluster
mode will be designed as single writer, multiple reader replicas with the same dataset, which will be updated using
an event stream from the primary source of truth.

The solution will be based on the assumption that the entire search index can be stored in RAM. Information that is
not used for retrieval but only for displaying to the user may or may not be stored in memory (we consider the use of
a [memory mapped file](https://medium.com/i0exception/memory-mapped-files-5e083e653b1)).

The data will be stored in memory as a sorted array of numeric primary identifiers of entities (products, categories,
tags, etc.) over which Boolean AND, OR, NOT operations will be performed, and then GROUP BY and SUM operations in
the pricing area. All operations will be performed in a so-called "lazy" manner, which promises better
performance in moments when complete results do not need to be computed (e.g. for the purpose of displaying the category
tree). Optimized data structures such as the [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) or the
[interval tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree) or [range tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_tree)
will be used for specific search operations.

The API and implementation will be designed so that as many related operations as possible are computed within a single
request using common intermediate results. The client will not have to compose the functionality with a large number
of database engine calls (in current solutions it is common for dozens of calls to a generic database engine to be
needed to display category details with product listings).

## Developing solutions for practical applicability

Based on the measurements, the best implementation option is selected and refined to production quality, which requires
extensive and clear documentation, coverage of automated units, integration and performance tests.

The goal is:

* to prepare HTTP APIs for communication with the outside world using commonly used formats:
	* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
	* [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
	* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
* containerization of the distribution package (using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/))
* extending the implementation to a clustered solution (required on all major e-commerce sites)
* publishing source files on generally accepted hosting platforms ([GitHub](https://github.com/),
  [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/))
* API documentation
* implementation of a sample e-commerce solution on top of this API with a basic dataset in JavaScript /
  [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Data model

<Note type="info">
See a more detailed [API schema(updating/schema_api), describing the data model manipulation.
</Note>

The minimal entity definition consists of: [Entity type](#entity-type) and [Primary key](#primary-key) (even this is optional
and may be automatically generated by the database). Other entity data is purely optional and may not be used at all.

This combination is covered by this interface: <SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/EntityReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>.
The full entity with data, references, attributes and associated data is represented by this interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/EntityContract.java</SourceClass>.

The schema for entities is described by:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/EntitySchema.java</SourceClass>

### Entity type

[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) is a type of entity.
Entity type is main business key (equivalent to a table name in relational database) - all data of entities with the same
type are stored in a separated index. Within the entity type, the entity is uniquely represented by its
[primary key](#primary-key).

Entity is described by its schema:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/EntitySchema.java</SourceClass>

Although evitaDB requires a schema for each entity type, it supports automatic evolution when you allow it. If you don't
specify otherwise, evitaDB learns about entity attributes, their data types and all necessary relations along the way
when you insert new data into it. However, once the attribute, associated data or other contours of the entity are known, they are
enforced by evitaDB. This mechanism somehow resembles the schema-less approach, but results in much more
consistent data store.

<Note type="info">
The details about [schema definition](updating/schema_api) are part of a different document.
</Note>

### Primary key

A unique [int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) positive number
(max. 2<sup>63</sup>-1) represents the entity. Can be used for fast lookup for entity (entities). The primary key must be
unique within the same [entity type](#entity-type).

May be left empty if it should be automatically generated by the database.
The primary key allows evitaDB to decide whether the entity should be inserted as a new entity, or an update to an existing entity.

### Hierarchical placement

Entities may be organized in a hierarchical fashion. That means that an entity may refer to a single parent entity and may be
referred to by multiple child entities. A hierarchy is always composed of entities of the same type.

Each entity must be part of, at most, a single hierarchy (tree).

Hierarchy placement is represented by this interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/HierarchicalPlacementContract.java</SourceClass>.

<Note type="info">
Most of the e-commerce systems organize their products in a hierarchical category system. The categories are
source for the catalog menus and when the user examines the category content, they usually see the products in the entire
category subtree of the category. That's why the hierarchies are directly supported by evitaDB.
</Note>

### Attributes (unique, filterable, sortable, localized)

Entity attributes allow defining sets of data that are fetched in bulk along with the entity body.
The attribute may be marked as filterable to enable filtering by it, or sortable to be sorted by it.
The attributes are not automatically searchable / sortable in order to not waste precious memory space and save
computational overhead for maintaining and an index for the data that will never be used in queries.

Attributes must be used for all of the data you want to filter or sort by. Attributes are recommended to also be used for
frequently used data that are associated with the entity (for example "name". "perex", "main motive") even if you don't
necessarily need it for querying purposes.

The attribute provider ([entity](#entity-type) or [reference](#references)) is represented by this interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/AttributesContract.java</SourceClass>

The attribute schema is described by this:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/AttributeSchema.java</SourceClass>

#### Allowed decimal places

The allowed decimal places setting represents optimizations that allow for converting rich numeric types (such as
[BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html) used for
precise number representation) to a primitive [int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
type that is much more compact and can be used for fast binary search in an array/bitset representation. The original rich
format is still present in an attribute container, but internally, the database uses the primitive form when an attribute is a
part of filtering or sorting constraints.

When a number cannot be converted to a compact form (for example it has more digits in the fractional part than expected), an
exception is thrown and the entity update is rejected.

#### Localized attributes

An attribute may contain localized values. It means that different values should be used for filtering / sorting and
should be returned along with the entity when a certain locale is used in the [search query](querying/query_language).
Localized attributes are standard part of most of the e-commerce systems, and that's why evitaDB provides special
treatment for those.

#### Data types in attributes

Attributes allow for the using of [variety of data types](model/data_types) and their arrays. The database supports all basic types,
date-time types and <SourceClass>evita_common/src/main/java/io/evitadb/dataType/Range.java</SourceClass> types.
Range values are allowed, using a special type of [search query](querying/query_language) filtering constraint -
[InRange](querying/query_language#in-range).

This filtering constraint allows filtering entities that are inside the range bounds. For more information, see the
[InRange](querying/query_language#in-range) documentation.

Any of the supported data types may be wrapped in an array - that means that the attribute might represent multiple
values at once. Such attributes cannot be used for sorting, but can be used for filtering, where it fulfills
the filtering constraint when **any** of the values in the array match the constraint predicate. This is particularly useful
for ranges where you can, for example, simply define multiple periods of validity and the [InRange](querying/query_language#in-range)
constraint will match all of the entities, which have at least one period enveloping the input date and time (this is another
frequently present use-case in e-commerce systems).

<Note type="info">
See the chapter [about all supported data types](model/data_types) for more information.
</Note>

### Associated data

Associated data carries additional data entries that are never used for filtering / sorting but may be needed to be fetched
along with an entity in order to display data to the target consumer (i.e. an user / API / bot). Associated data allows for the
storing of all basic [data types](model/data_types) and also complex, document like types.

The complex data type is used for rich objects, such as Java POJOs and is [automatically converted by](associated_data_implicit_conversion)
to an internal representation that is composed solely of supported data types (or another complex objects) and can be
deserialized back to the client in a custom POJO on demand, providing that the POJO structure matches the original document format.

The associated aata provider ([entity](#entity-type)) is represented by this interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/AssociatedDataContract.java</SourceClass>

The associated data schema is described by this:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/AssociatedDataSchema.java</SourceClass>

The [search query](querying/query_language) must contain specific [requirements](querying/query_language#require)
to fetch the associated data along with the entity. Associated data are stored and fetched separately by their name.

#### Localized associated data

The associated data value may contain localized values. It means that different values should be returned along with an entity
when a certain locale is used in the [search query](querying/query_language). Localized data is a standard part of most
of the e-commerce systems, and that's why evitaDB provides special treatment for those.

### References

The references, as the name suggests, refer to other entities (of the same or different entity type).
The references enable entity filtering by the attributes defined on the reference relation or the attributes of
the referenced entities. The references enable [statistics](#parameters-faceted-search) computation if the
facet index is enabled for this referenced entity type. The reference is uniquely represented by an
[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
positive number (max. 2<sup>63</sup>-1) and a [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)
entity type and can represent a <Term>facet</Term> that is a part of one or multiple <Term name="facet group">facet groups</Term>,
which are also identified by an [int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html).
The reference identifier in one entity is unique and belongs to a single group id. Among multiple entities, the reference
to the same referenced entity may be a part of different groups.

The referenced entity type may relate to another entity managed by evitaDB, or it may refer to any external entity
possessing a unique [int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) key as its identifier.
We expect that evitaDB will maintain data only partially, and that it will co-exist with other systems in one runtime -
such as content management systems, warehouse systems, ERPs and so on.

The references may carry additional key-value data linked to this entity relation (fe. item count present on the
relation to a stock). The data on references is subject to the same rules as [entity attributes](#attributes-unique-filterable-sortable-localized).

A reference is represented by this interface: <SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/ReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>.
A reference schema is described by this: <SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/ReferenceSchema.java</SourceClass>

### Prices

Prices are specific to very few entity types (usually products, shipping methods and so on), but because correct price
computation is very complex and an important part of the e-commerce systems and highly affects performance of the entities
filtering and sorting, they deserve first class support in entity model. It is pretty common in B2B systems for a single
product to have  dozens of assigned prices for different customers.

A price provider is represented by this interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/PricesContract.java</SourceClass>
Single price is represented by the interface:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/PriceContract.java</SourceClass>

A price schema is part of the main entity schema:
<SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/schema/EntitySchema.java</SourceClass>

## Entity indexing

<Note type="info">
See a more detailed [entity API](/updating/entity_api) describing entity manipulation.
</Note>

The entity indexing is a mechanism that stores [entity data](#data-model) into the persistent storage and prepares
the data for searching. We distinguish two types of this mechanism:

- [bulk](#bulk-indexation)
- [incremental](#incremental-indexation)

### Bulk indexing

Bulk indexing is used for rapid indexing of large quantities of source data. It's used for initial catalog setup from an
external (primary) data store. It doesn't need to support transactions. Whenever something goes wrong, the work in
progress might be thrown away entirely without affecting any clients (because it's initial DB setup, no client is
reading from it yet). The goal here is to index hundreds or thousands entities per second.

Bulk indexation is executed in single-threaded fashion.

### Incremental indexing

Incremental indexing is used for keeping index up-to-date during its lifetime. We expect some form of [change data
capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) process to be incorporated in the primary data store.
Incremental indexing must support transactions at least with the [read commited isolation level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_committed).
Initial implementations may relax the concurrency and limit parallelism so that only single write transaction may be open
at a time. Multiple parallel read transactions must be supported in the final implementation since the beginning and
simultaneous read/write transactions must be supported as well.

Rolled back transaction must not affect the working data set. Committed transaction must leave data set in a consistent
state and must be resistant to unexpected process termination or hardware failure (committed data should enforce fsync
to a persistent disk storage).

Incremental indexing should be as fast as possible, but since there are bigger requirements, it is expected to be
considerably slower than [bulk indexation](#bulk-indexing).

## Data fetching

Only the primary keys of the entities are returned to the query result by default. Each entity in this simplest case is
represented by the <SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/EntityReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>
interface.

The client application can request for the returning entity bodies instead, but this must be explicitly requested by using a specific
require constraint:

- [entity fetch](querying/query_language#entity-body)
- [attribute fetch](querying/query_language#attributes)
- [associated data fetch](querying/query_language#associated-data)
- [price fetch](querying/query_language#prices)

When such a require constraint is used, data is fetched *greedily* during the initial query. A response object will then
contain entities in the form of an <SourceClass branch="POC">evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/data/EntityContract.java</SourceClass>.

### Lazy fetching (enrichment)

Attributes, associated data and prices can be fetched separately by providing the primary key of the entity. The initial entity
is loaded by the [entity fetch](querying/query_language#entity-body) or by a limited set of requirements can be lazily expanded (enriched)
with additional data by so-called *lazy loading*.

This process loads the above-mentioned data separately and adds them to the entity object anytime after it was initially
fetched from evitaDB. Due to the immutability characteristics enforced by the database design, the entity object enrichment
leads to a new instance.

Lazy fetching may not be necessary for a frontend designed using the MVC architecture, where all requirements for the page
are known prior to rendering. But different architectures might fetch thinner entity forms and later discover that
they need more data in it. While this approach is not optimal performance-wise, it might make the life for developers
easier, and it's much more optimal to just enrich an existing query (using lookup by primary key and fetching only missing
data) instead of re-fetching the entire entity again.

## Query requirements

<Note type="info">
See more detailed [query API](/updating/query_api) and [query language](querying/query_language) in
separate chapters.
</Note>

Querying is the heart of all databases, and therefore, the core of the query language was designed upfront in
the prototype implementation phase along with the unified functional test suite. When the first versions of
the prototype implementations were created, the functional suite also accompanied the performance test suite, first for the
artificial data set, and later, for real customer data sets.

This chapter briefly describes the use-cases the e-commerce catalog frequently solves and which we try to cover in
our [query language](querying/query_language) document and the [API](querying/query_api) document.

#### Attributes

We need to fully support basic [boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) (AND, OR, NOT) with
[parentheses grouping logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses_in_programming_languages) that supports
predicates:

* **numeric:** equals, greater than, lesser than, between, in range
* **temporal:** equals, greater than, lesser than, between, in range
* **string:** contains, starts with, ends with
* **boolean:** is null, is not null

##### Localized search

The items in the multi-language catalogs often only have a limited set of localizations (translations). The search
engine must easily filter only those items that are available in selected locale. Let's assume that this specific
<Term>brand</Term> is referred to by items with the following localizations:

* **Product A**: EN, CZ, IT
* **Product B**: EN, DE, FR
* **Product C**: EN, CZ, PL

When the query lists all items referring to that brand and specifies the locale equal to `EN`, all items needs to be
returned, while using locale equal to `CZ` lists only items `Product A` and `Product C`.

#### Parameters (faceted search)

Faceted search is commonly used on all major e-commerce sites. Facets represent properties of items in a certain area that
is significant for customers to pick the correct item to buy. Faceted search cam be usually found in the <Term>category</Term>
drill down view, specific <Term>group</Term> pages or the <Term>fulltext search</Term> result page.

According to some studies - properly implemented faceted search (sometimes called as parametrized search) can [increase
conversions of the e-commerce sites by 20%](https://searchspring.com/how-experts-optimize-category-navigation-in-ecommerce/).
Each product can have multiple parameters in the form of a key-value map. Values might represent:

- discrete constants (for example color:black, size:XXL, OS:Android) visualized as checkboxes or selects
- or numeric values that are spread out in some range and can be visualized as a slider with min and max boundaries

Parameters - <Term name="facet">facets</Term> are organized and grouped into <Term name="facet group">facet groups</Term>
by their similarity (color, size, operation system). When the user enters the category page (or any other item listing view)
they should only see facets (facet groups) that make sense in that category. In other words - the only facets visible
in the filter are those that are linked to (referenced by) at least one item visible in the view (ignoring pagination
settings).

For better customer orientation on how a certain facet narrows the item listing e-commerce sites display or
the number of the items that have a certain property next to it - see this example (numbers in brackets):

[![Faceted search on Alzashop.com](assets/faceted_search_example.png "Faceted search on Alzashop.com")](https://www.alzashop.com/processors/18842843.htm)

An even better approach is to reflect the currently selected filter in the faceted filter itself. Additional facets
that would return no result if selected are displayed as disabled (see grayed properties with zero brackets in above
example).

<Note type="info">
See the [description of the facet summary object](classes/facet_lookup_summary) for better understanding.
</Note>

##### Interval properties

E-commerce filters contain not only facet,s but also sliders that allow the user to search for items having the attribute
in a certain value range. For example, when you buy a refrigerator, you are usually constrained by the space at your disposal,
and you need to set limits for the width, length and height of the refrigerator.

Example:

[![Faceted search on Senesi.cz](assets/faceted_search_interval.png "Faceted search on Senesi.cz")](https://www.senesi.cz/umyvadla)

**The search engine must:**

* return thresholds for each interval property (stored as entity [attribute](#attributes-unique-filterable-sortable-localized)):
	* highest value of the property in the item view
	* lowest value of the property in the item view
* optionally: compute the histogram of describing attribute values computed from the items in this view (i.e. threshold with a
count of items having this property in a respective histogram interval)

<Note type="info">
See the [histogram object](classes/histogram) for better understanding.
</Note>

##### Inverted relations

Facets in the same facet group are usually combined by a boolean OR (disjunction) relation and facets in different groups are
combined by a boolean AND (conjunction) relation. These relations might be inverted in some edge cases and the database
must support the definition of inverted relations among facet groups and the facets within a certain group.

##### Negative properties

Some facets might have a negative meaning - so that if a user marks them, they expect that listing to only contain
items that don‚Äôt have such property (as an example consider this facet: allergen:gluten which will cause that all items
containing gluten will be removed from the listing).

**When a facet with negative meaning (defined on property group) is selected in the filter, the search engine must:**

* EXCLUDE all items having such property from the result
* properly compute the number of selected records

##### Impact statistics

Facets that would further expand count of the matching items (if selected) display difference count with the plus sign,
or the updated overall result count next to them. See example below (numbers in brackets):

[![Extended facet statistics on CZC.cz](assets/faceted_search_extended_statistics.png "Extended facet statistics on CZC.cz")](https://www.czc.cz/herni-notebooky/produkty?q-c-0-f_137581190=sSSD)

**When any facet filtering is applied in the passed database query, the search engine must:**

* return extended statistics computed for all other facets that contains information about:
	* how many items are added to result if facet would be added to filtering
	* how many items are removed from result if facet would be added to filtering
	* how many items remain in the result if facet would be added to filtering
* correctly apply OR / AND / NOT relations defined by property groups

#### Prices

The search engine can search for products whose *price for sale* falls within the price range specified by the user.
The price for sale must respect the selected currency, price date/time validity range and relates to one of the price list
identifiers available to the user. All this information is part of the input query.

For master products, the lowest price of any product variant is used. For complete sets, dual behaviour must be
supported:

- if a price is set directly for a set, count with this price
- if not, the most preferred price for each item of such a set must be added up and the resulting amount calculated

<Note type="info">
The exact and detailed [price for sale computation algorithm](querying/price_computation) is described in separate chapter.
</Note>

##### Price histogram

Optionally, we would like to be able to generate a histogram of prices similar to
[interval properties](#interval-properties).

#### Brands / groups

E-commerce sites have special landing pages for <Term name="brands">brands</Term> / manufacturers or <Term name="groups">groups</Term>.
These landing pages behave similar to category detail page and display all items directly related to the brand / group.
The search engine must be able to compute facets and all other information for all entities that relate (have reference to) the
specified external entity.

##### The number of products of a given brand in the categories

The search engine needs to look up, for all hierarchy placements (categories), where at least one product of that brand
is (directly or transitively) located for any of the <Term>brands</Term> or <Term>groups</Term>. The detail of the brand
frequently lists all categories of products the brand produces.

#### Tags

Tags behave in the same way as described in the [faceted search chapter](#parameters-faceted-search). The search engine
must be able to return a list of labels that are used in any currently visible product in the selected category and
subcategories.

#### Fulltext search

The solution should allow to easily combine full-text search with parametrized (faceted search). Fulltext search
may not be implemented initially, but should offer a mechanism for integration of an external fulltext system.

##### Hierarchical search and tree exclusion

<Term name="Categories">Categories</Term> are usually organized in a hierarchical fashion. A single product may be listed
in one or more categories. E-commerce sites usually display all products in a specific category or its subcategories.
Certain categories might be excluded from the displaying by the site owner or might be accessible only to a subset
of the frontend users (by design). The search engine should take all of these requirements into account and should
transparently exclude all items that are only a part of the excluded category subtree.

The search engine should assist in menu generation from the hierarchical tree in real time, listing only those hierarchical
entities (<Term name="category">categories</Term>) that:

* match the basic attribute predicate: for example, those are marked as visible, are valid for display at that certain moment in time etc.
* contain at least one visible product in any child level, the product must:
	* match an independent attribute query
	* match the requested locale
	* produce a price for sale

For each of returned entity (<Term>category</Term>), the search engine must:

* compute the overall count of all items available in this entity (<Term>category</Term>)
	* items that have an invisible parent (<Term>category</Term> that doesn't match its own predicate) must not be counted
	* a single item (<Term>product</Term>) may relate to more than one hierarchical parent  (<Term>category</Term>),
	  the fact that a product is not counted in one category axis must not affect the other visibility axis
	* counts of lower level nodes are automatically counted in the overall count of their parent category
* produce a result in a tree-like structure friendly for rendering

#### Product sorting

The search engine must be able to sort results by:

* **attribute:** for example, the number of stars, number of sales
* **multiple attributes:** there are special cases where one attribute contains less selective values and another
  attribute is required for predictable search results
* **price for sale:** cheapest, most expensive

##### Personalized sorting

As a part of the research, it would be useful to look at the possibilities of personalized sorting, which would allow
a user to be presented with the results that are likely to be of interest to them first, based on their previous
experience with that user (i.e., based on their previous purchases or visits).

For this purpose, it will probably be necessary to use one of the "shallow" artificial intelligence (machine learning)
algorithms and construct a personalised search index in such a way that the search is not slowed down.

This functionality is not critical to the evaluation of the winning approach - it is an add-on functionality that
no existing database currently includes as part of its functionality. However, we know that global trends are moving
in this direction.

<Note type="info">
The last paragraph was written in the year 2018. As of now,
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/knn-search.html) supports a
k-nearest neighbour algorithm that could be used for personalized sorting. Also, there is a mature database
[Vespa.ai](https://vespa.ai/) oriented on machine learning assisted fulltext search and recommendation.
