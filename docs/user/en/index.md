evitaDB helps developers to create fast product catalog applications, which are the heart of every e-commerce site.
Catalogs work with hierarchical structures, facet search, price search, range search, localisation and fulltext.
All these requirements could be solved by general-purpose databases - either relational like [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/),
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), no-sql like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
But in reality, these tasks are quite complex for all these databases and require a lot of work on the part of 
the application developer. The e-commerce problems can be solved in many ways in these databases, but initial and
often naive implementations happen to be very under-performing when the dataset grows larger, or quickly become hard
to maintain and evolve further.

The developers of evitaDB have been implementing e-commerce stores on various database platforms for several years. We
have experience with multi-page SQL queries, lock wait timeouts, data de-normalisation and other side-effects of 
traditional relational solutions. We have also tasted the dark side of distributed non-SQL databases
which also required multi-page queries and revealed problems with (lack of) transactionality, eventual consistency
and hard-to-understand schema definition and querying. We have always felt that we trade a lot of simplicity for the sake of
acceptable latency, and we aim for a system that is both simple and performant for the majority of e-commerce
use cases. The plug and play device that just works.

That's why we applied for [an EU research grant](https://evitadb.io/project-info), which allowed us to dedicate necessary
time trying to create an alternative to general-purpose databases, that would meet our needs. The [progress
and results of our research](https://evitadb.io/research/introduction) happening between 2019 and 2022 are documented 
in the separate part of this site.

##### Use at your own risk and responsibility
</NoteTitle>

evitaDB is currently in alpha version and a lot of development is going on right now. We plan to stabilize the first 
generally available version at the beginning of 2024. Until that time, the storage format may change at any time, which 
will require all existing data to be dropped and re-indexed from the primary storage.

**Please do not use evitaDB to store your primary data for the reasons mentioned above.**

In the fall of 2023, we plan to release a beta version and deploy it first to our own customers to gain first-hand 
experience using it ourselves. When we can be sure that the database engine is stable and reliable, we will release 
the first version to the general public.
