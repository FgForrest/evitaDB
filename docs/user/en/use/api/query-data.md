**Work in progress**

This article will contain description of the data API regarding entity querying. It should not contain information
about query language, which is described elsewhere.
Part of this chapter can reuse information from:

- [data fetching](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/index#data-fetching)
- [query API](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/querying/query_api)

... and will refer to [query language](../query/basics.md)
