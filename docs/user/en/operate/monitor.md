**Work in progress**

This article will contain description of Evita monitoring facilities - would it be directly Prometheus or OpenTelemetry.
There should be also information how to log slow queries or see other problems within application (logging).
The functionality is not finalized - [see issue #18](https://github.com/FgForrest/evitaDB/issues/18).
