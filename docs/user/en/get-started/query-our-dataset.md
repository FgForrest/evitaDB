title: Query our dataset
perex: |
   This article will show you how to connect to our demo instance or spin up a demo instance on your own hardware and 
   experiment with the evitaDB query language.

While it is much better to play with the schema and data that suits your own e-commerce use case, we believe that
many of you will want to test the Query API without too much work. Therefore, we have created a sample schema of 
the virtual e-commerce store with data for more than a thousand products for you to play with right away.

There are two ways in which you can play with this data set:

1. simple but limited: [use our evitaDB.io server instance](#use-our-evitadbio-server-instance)
2. more difficult, but without limits: [run your own evitaDB server with our dataset](#run-your-own-evitadb-server-with-our-dataset)

## Use our evitaDB.io server instance

We host the demo dataset directly on the [evitadb.io](https://evitadb.io) site, but to make sure it works reliably for 
all of you, we had to make it read-only. So you cannot make any changes to it. But you can still use it to test all our 
web APIs and all supported drivers.

The next limitation is that the server is hosted on cheap shared infrastructure of  
[Contabo hosting](https://contabo.com/en/vps/) (which has been known to buy old servers to provide low-cost hosting 
services) with following specs:

![Server specs](assets/contabo-hosting.png)

If you experience slow responses, let us know and 
[try evitaDB on your hardware instead](#run-your-own-evitadb-server-with-our-dataset).

You can access all our APIs on these addresses:

- `graphQL` API: [https://demo.evitadb.io:5555/gql/](https://demo.evitadb.io:5555/gql/)
- `REST` API: [https://demo.evitadb.io:5555/rest/](https://demo.evitadb.io:5555/rest/)
- `gRPC` API: [https://demo.evitadb.io:5556/](https://demo.evitadb.io:5556/)

## Run your own evitaDB server with our dataset

This option requires more work, but you will have control over the performance, and you will be able to modify any data 
in the set. To access the dataset on your hardware, you need to:

1. [download the archive with the dataset](https://evitadb.io/download/evita-demo-dataset.zip)
   ```bash
   wget https://evitadb.io/download/evita-demo-data.zip
   ```

2. unzip the contents to the `data` folder
   ```bash
   unzip -d data evita-demo-dataset.zip
   ```

3. pull the evitaDB docker image
   ```bash
   docker pull index.docker.io/evitadb/evitadb:latest
   ```
4. start the evitaDB server
   ```bash
   docker run --name evitadb -i --net=host \
          -v "./data:/evita/data" \
          index.docker.io/evitadb/evitadb:latest
   ```

When this procedure is completed you should see the similar output in the console:

```plain

            _ _        ____  ____  
  _____   _(_) |_ __ _|  _ \| __ )

It means that your evitaDB server is up and running, and also that it has loaded the `evita` catalog dataset with some
thousands of products.

## Connect the Java client

Open your Java IDE and create an <SourceClass>evita_external_api/evita_external_api_grpc/client/src/main/java/io/evitadb/driver/EvitaClient.java</SourceClass>
instance:

<SourceCodeTabs>
[Connect the demo server](/docs/user/en/get-started/example/connect-demo-server.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

After that you can create a new session and try any of the evitaQL queries described in 
[the reference documentation](../query/basics.md):

<SourceCodeTabs requires="ignoreTest,/docs/user/en/get-started/example/connect-demo-server.java" langSpecificTabOnly>
