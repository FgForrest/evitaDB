The [query in evitaDB](../query/basics.md) is represented by a tree of nested "constraints" divided into four <LS to="g">_logical_</LS> parts:

<dl>
    <dt>`collection`</dt>
    <dd>it identifies the collection to query</dd>
    <dt>`filterBy`</dt>
    <dd>it limits the number of results returned</dd>
    <dt>`orderBy`</dt>
    <dd>it specifies the order in which the results are returned</dd>
    <dt>`require`</dt>
    <dd>it allows you to pass additional information about how much data the returned entities should have,
    (how complete the returned entity should be) how many of them are needed, and what other calculations should be
    performed on them</dd>
</dl>

<LS to="e,j,c">

The *evitaQL* (evitaDB Query Language) entry point is represented by
<LS to="e,j"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Query.cs</SourceClass></LS> class, and looks like this
a [Lisp flavored language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)). It always starts with
the name of the constraint, followed by a set of arguments in parentheses. You can even use other functions
in those arguments. An example of such a query might look like this:

<LS to="g,r">

The *evitaQL* (evitaDB Query Language) is represented by JSON object of nested constraints. Each nested property
always starts with name of the constraint followed by a set of arguments as property value. You can even use other
constraints in those arguments. An example of such a query might look like this:

[EvitaQL example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/evita-query-example.java)

<LS to="e">

evitaQL is represented by a simple
[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) which is parsed to
an abstract syntax tree consisting of constraints
(<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Constraint.java</SourceClass>) encapsulated in
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> object.
</LS>

We have designed the *evitaQL* string representation to look similar to a query defined directly in the *Java* language.
We also try to preserve the "look & feel" of the original evitaQL in different languages / APIs like REST, GraphQL or C#
while respecting the conventions and capabilities of the respective language.

evitaQL is used in the gRPC protocol and can optionally be used for the embedded Java environment. It can also be used
in [evitaDB console](/documentation/blog/en/09-our-new-web-client-evitalab). The GraphQL and REST Web API use a similar format, but adapted to
the protocol conventions (so that we can take advantage of the Open API / GQL schema).

<LS to="j">

## Defining queries in Java code

In order to create a query, use the static `query` methods in the
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> class to create a query and then
compose inner constraints from the static methods in
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/QueryConstraints.java</SourceClass>.

When this class is imported statically, the Java query definition looks like the string form of the query.
Thanks to type inference, the IDE will help you with auto-completion of the constraints that make sense in a particular
context.

This is an example of how the query is composed and how evitaDB is called. The example imports two classes statically:
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> and
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/QueryConstraints.java</SourceClass>.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Java query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/java-query-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

### Automatic query cleaning

The query may also contain "dirty" parts - that is, null constraints and unnecessary parts:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Java dirty query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/java-dirty-query-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

The query is automatically cleaned and unnecessary constraints are removed before it is processed by the evitaDB engine.

### Query parsing

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/QueryParser.java</SourceClass> class allows to parse
[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) query to the AST
form of the <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> class.
The string notation of *evitaQL* can be created at any time by calling the `toString()` method on the
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> object.

The parser supports passing values by reference, copying the proven approach of a JDBC
[prepared statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/prepared.html)
which allows the use of the `?` character in the query and returns an array of correctly sorted input parameters.

It also supports so-called
[named queries](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/namedparam/NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.html),
which are widely used in the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc), using variables in the
query with the format `@name` and providing a [map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) with
the named input parameters.

In the opposite direction, it offers the `toStringWithParameterExtraction` method on the
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> class object, which allows to
create the string format for *evitaQL* in the form of a *prepared statement* and extract all parameters in a separate
array.

### Query manipulation

There are several handy visitors (more will be added) that allow you to work with the query. They are placed in the package
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/visitor/</SourceClass>, and some have shortcut methods
in the <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/QueryUtils.java</SourceClass> class.

The query can be "pretty-printed" by using the `prettyPrint` method on the
<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/Query.java</SourceClass> class.

## Data fetching

By default, only primary keys of entities are returned in the query result. In this simplest case, each entity is
represented by the
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/EntityReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>
interface.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Default query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/default-query-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

The client application can request returning entity bodies instead, but this must be explicitly requested using
a specific require constraint (or their combination):

- [entity fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md)
- [attribute fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#attributes)
- [associated data fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#associated-data)
- [price fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#prices)
- [reference fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#references)

When such a require constraint is used, data will be fetched *greedily* during the initial request. The response object
will then contain entities in the form of
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/SealedEntity.java</SourceClass>.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Fetching example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/fetching-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

Although there are simpler variants for querying entities, the typical method is `query` that returns a complex object
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/EvitaResponse.java</SourceClass> containing:

- **<SourceClass>evita_common/src/main/java/io/evitadb/dataType/DataChunk.java</SourceClass>** with result entities in
  the form of <SourceClass>evita_common/src/main/java/io/evitadb/dataType/PaginatedList.java</SourceClass> or
  <SourceClass>evita_common/src/main/java/io/evitadb/dataType/StripList.java</SourceClass>
- [Map](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) of extra results indexed by their
  class (`<T extends EvitaResponseExtraResult> Map<Class<T>, T>`)

The next example documents fetching the second page of products in a category with calculated facet statistics:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Fetching example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/query-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

There are shortcuts for calling query with the expected entity form so that you don't need to declare the expected
entity form in the second argument of the `query` method:

- `queryEntityReference` producing <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/structure/EntityReference.java</SourceClass>
- `querySealedEntity` producing <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/SealedEntity.java</SourceClass>

### Lazy fetching (enrichment)

Attributes, associated data, prices and references can be fetched separately by providing the primary key of the entity.
The initial entity loaded by [entity fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md) with a limited set of requirements
can be enriched later with missing data.

To enrich, a.k.a. lazy fetch missing data to an existing entity, you must pass the existing entity to an `enrichEntity`
method and specify a set of additional require constraints that should be satisfied. Due to immutability properties
enforced by database design, enriching an entity object returns a new instance of the entity.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Lazy loading example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/lazy-fetch-example.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

Lazy fetching may not be necessary for a frontend designed using an MVC architecture, where all requirements for the
page are known before rendering. But different architectures might fetch thinner entity forms and later discover that
they need more data in them. While this approach is not optimal performance-wise, it may make life easier for
developers, and it's much more optimal to just enrich the existing entity (using lookup by primary key and fetching
only missing data) instead of fetching the entire entity again.

<Note type="warning">
Lazy Fetching is currently only fully implemented for embedded evitaDB. If you are using evitaDB remotely via
<SourceClass>evita_external_api/evita_external_api_grpc/client/src/main/java/io/evitadb/driver/EvitaClient.java</SourceClass>
you can still use the `enrichEntity` method on the
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/EvitaSessionContract.java</SourceClass> interface, but the entity
will be fully fetched again. However, we plan to optimize this scenario in the future.
</Note>

## Custom contracts

Data retrieved from evitaDB is represented by the internal evitaDB data structures, which use the domain names
associated with the evitaDB representation. You may want to use your own domain names and data structures in your
application. Fortunately, evitaDB allows you to define your own contracts for data retrieval and use them to fetch and
[write data](write-data.md#custom-contracts) to evitaDB. This chapter describes how to define custom contracts for data
retrieval. Basic requirements and usage patterns are described in the [Java Connector chapter](../connectors/java.md#custom-contracts).

The read contract is expected to be used for both [schema definition](schema-api.md#declarative-schema-definition) and
data retrieval. However, you can have multiple read contracts with different scopes representing the exact same entity.

In addition to [schema controlling annotations](schema-api.md#schema-controlling-annotations), which you can use to
describe your read contract, you can also use shortcut annotations, which don't require you to repeat all of the entity
structure details required for the schema definition:

<dl>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/EntityRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on methods that should return different entity body.
    </dd>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PrimaryKeyRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on methods returning number data type (usually [int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html))
        that should return primary key assigned to the entity.
    </dd>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/AttributeRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on methods that should return entity or reference [attribute](#attribute).
    </dd>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/AssociatedDataRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on methods that should return entity [associated data](#associated-data).
        If the associated data represents a custom Java type converted into [complex data type](../data-types.md#complex-data-types),
        the implementation provides automatic conversion for that data type.
    </dd>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PriceForSaleRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on method returning
        <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/PriceContract.java</SourceClass> type
        to provide access to price for sale of the entity.
    </dd>
    <dt><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/ReferenceRef.java</SourceClass></dt>
    <dd>
        Annotation can be placed on methods that should return entity [reference](#reference) to another entity.
        It can point to another model class (interface/class/record) that contains properties for `@ReferencedEntity`
        and `@ReferencedEntityGroup` annotations and relation attributes or directly to different entity read contract
        annotated with `@Entity` or `@EntityRef` annotation.
    </dd>
</dl>

<Note type="warning">

Because evitaDB allows partial fetches of the entity, not all data in the contract may be available. If you access it,
you will get a NULL value, which can represent both the fact that the data is not available and the fact that the data
does not exist. If you need to distinguish between these two cases, your methods should use the
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/exception/ContextMissingException.java</SourceClass>.
This exception is a runtime exception, so the caller is not forced to handle it, but it signals the automatic evitaDB
implementation to throw an exception if the requested data was not fetched with the entity.

Lazy loading of data is not yet supported for custom contracts, but we plan to automatically fetch missing data if
the method call occurs in a scope where the evita session is available.

</Note>

All the examples in this chapter come in three variants: interface, record, and class. The interface variant is the most
versatile and can also be applied to classes. However, if you follow the record or class examples with final fields,
where the data is passed through the constructor, you're limited in some features and other behavior:

- You cannot distinguish between the fact that the data was not fetched and the fact that the data does not exist.
- You cannot use controllable accessors that change output based on method parameters (for example, `String getName(Locale locale)`),
  because there is no way to represent the method parameters in the constructor arguments.

The record and immutable class example variants are suitable for secondary data structures or simplified structures
returned as a result of reference getter calls, where you don't need the full-fledged read contract.

Methods annotated with these annotations must follow the expected method signature conventions:

### Primary key

In order to access the primary key of the entity, you must use number data type (usually
[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)) and annotate it with the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PrimaryKey.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PrimaryKeyRef.java</SourceClass> annotation:

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with primary key access](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/primary-key-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

### Attributes

To access the entity or reference attribute, you must use the appropriate data type and annotate it with the
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/Attribute.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/AttributeRef.java</SourceClass>
annotation. The data type can be wrapped in [Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html)
(or its counterparts [OptionalInt](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalInt.html)
or [OptionalLong](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalLong.html)).

If the attribute represents a multi-value type (array), you can also wrap it in [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html)
(or its specializations [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)
or [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html)). The rules apply to both for entity and reference attributes:

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with attribute access](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/attribute-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

<Note type="info">

Java enum data types are automatically converted to evitaDB string data type using the `name()` method and vice versa
using the `valueOf()` method.

</Note>

<Note type="warning">

Avoid declaring methods that return a primitive data type without throwing the `ContextMissingException`. The method
call may fail with a `NullPointerException` if the data wasn't fetched even though it was declared as mandatory
(not nullable).

</Note>

### Associated data

To access the entity or reference associated data, you must use the appropriate data type and annotate it with
the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/AssociatedData.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/AssociatedDataRef.java</SourceClass>
annotation. The data type can be wrapped in [Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html)
(or its counterparts [OptionalInt](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalInt.html)
or [OptionalLong](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalLong.html)).

If the associated data represents a multi-value type (array), you can also wrap it in [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html)
(or its specializations [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)
or [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html)).

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with associated data access](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/associated-data-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

If the method returns ["non-supported data type"](../data-types.md#simple-data-types) evitaDB automatically converts the data
from ["complex data type"](../data-types.md#complex-data-types) using [documented deserialization rules](../data-types.md#deserialization).

### Prices

To access the entity prices, you must always work with
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/PriceContract.java</SourceClass> data type
and annotate the methods with the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/Price.java</SourceClass>,
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PriceForSale.java</SourceClass> or
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/PriceForSaleRef.java</SourceClass>
annotation. The datatype can be wrapped in
[Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html)
(or its counterparts [OptionalInt](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalInt.html)
or [OptionalLong](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalLong.html)).

If the method can return multiple prices, you need to wrap it in [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html)
(or its specializations [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) or [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html)).

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with prices](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/price-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

The method may return null if the entity is a root entity. Therefore, it's not recommended to use primitive data types,
because the method call may fail with a `NullPointerException` in such a case.

### Hierarchy

To access the hierarchy placement information of the entity (i.e., its parent), you must use either the numeric data
type, your own custom interface type, <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/SealedEntity.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/structure/EntityReference.java</SourceClass>
data type and annotate it with the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/ParentEntity.java</SourceClass>
annotation. The datatype can be wrapped in
[Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html)
(or its counterparts [OptionalInt](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalInt.html)
or [OptionalLong](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalLong.html)).

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with parent access](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/parent-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

The method may return null if the entity is a root entity. Therefore, it's not recommended to use primitive data types,
because the method call may fail with a `NullPointerException` in such a case.

### References

To access the references of the entity, you must use either the numeric data type, your own custom interface type,
<SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/EntityReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/ReferenceContract.java</SourceClass>
data type and annotate it with the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/Reference.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/ReferenceRef.java</SourceClass>
annotation. The datatype can be wrapped in
[Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html)
(or its counterparts [OptionalInt](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalInt.html)
or [OptionalLong](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/OptionalLong.html)).


If the method can return multiple references, you need to wrap it in [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html)
(or its specializations [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) or [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html)).

<SourceAlternativeTabs variants="interface|record|class">

[Example interface with references](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/reference-read-interface.java)

</SourceAlternativeTabs>

When you declare to return a custom interface, you can return either the custom interface of the referenced entity
(i.e., an interface annotated with <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/Entity.java</SourceClass>
or <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/annotation/EntityRef.java</SourceClass>)
or interface mapping the reference. The latter allows you to access attributes of the reference and may also contain
additional methods to access the referenced entity. In the former case, you can access the referenced entity, but not
the reference attributes.

Methods annotated with this annotation should respect the cardinality of the reference. If the cardinality is
`EXACTLY_ONE` or `ZERO_OR_ONE`, the method should directly return the entity or the reference to it. If the cardinality
is `ZERO_OR_MORE` or `ONE_OR_MORE`, the method should return a collection or array of entities or references to them.

### Access to evitaDB data structures

Your read contract can implement the following interfaces to access the underlying evitaDB data structures:

<dl>

<Note type="info">

All generated proxies automatically implement the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/proxy/EvitaProxy.java</SourceClass>
interface, so you can distinguish them from other classes.

</Note>

<Note type="warning">

evitaDB cannot provide an automatic implementation for these interfaces if your read contract is a record or a
final/sealed class. In such cases you have to implement these interfaces manually.

## Caching considerations

If you're using embedded evitaDB and [don't disable the feature](../../operate/configure.md#cache-configuration),
the evitaDB engine automatically caches intermediate calculation results and frequently used entity bodies up to the
defined memory limit. Details about caching are [described here](../../deep-dive/cache.md). For embedded environments
the implementation of an own cache on top of the evitaDB cache is not recommended.

If you are using
<SourceClass>evita_external_api/evita_external_api_grpc/client/src/main/java/io/evitadb/driver/EvitaClient.java</SourceClass>,
implementing the local cache may save you network costs and give you better latency. The problem is related to cache
invalidation. You'd have to query only the entity references that contain version information and fetch the entities
that are not in the cache with a separate request. So instead of one network request, you have to make two. The benefit
of the local cache is therefore somewhat questionable.

## Defining queries in C# code

In order to create a query and to compose inner constraints, use the static methods in
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/IQueryConstraints.cs</SourceClass>.

When this class is imported statically, the C# query definition looks like the string form of the query.
Thanks to type inference, the IDE will help you with auto-completion of the constraints that make sense in a particular
context.

This is an example of how the query is composed and how evitaDB is called.
The example imports previously mentioned interface
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/IQueryConstraints.cs</SourceClass> statically.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[C# query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/csharp-query-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

### Automatic query cleaning

The query may also contain "dirty" parts - that is, null constraints and unnecessary parts:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[C# dirty query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/csharp-dirty-query-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

The query is automatically cleaned and unnecessary constraints are removed before it is processed by the evitaDB engine.

### Query manipulation

There are several handy visitors (more will be added) that allow you to work with the query. They are placed under the
`EvitaDB.Client.Queries.Visitor` namespace and some have shortcut methods
in the <SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Utils/QueryUtils.cs</SourceClass> class.

The query can be "pretty-printed" by using the `PrettyPrint` method on the
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Query.cs</SourceClass> class.

### Data fetching

By default, only primary keys of entities are returned in the query result. In this simplest case, each entity is
represented by the
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/Data/IEntityReference.cs</SourceClass>
interface.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Default query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/default-query-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

The client application can request returning entity bodies instead, but this must be explicitly requested using
a specific require constraint (or their combination):

- [entity fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md)
- [attribute fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#attributes)
- [associated data fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#associated-data)
- [price fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#prices)
- [reference fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md#references)

When such a `require` constraint is used, data will be fetched *greedily* during the initial request. The response object
will then contain entities in the form of
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/Data/ISealedEntity.cs</SourceClass>.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Fetching example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/fetching-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

Although there are simpler variants for querying entities, the typical method is `Query` that returns a complex object
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/EvitaResponse.cs</SourceClass> containing:

- **<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/DataTypes/IDataChunk.cs</SourceClass>** with result entities in
  the form of <SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/DataTypes/PaginatedList.cs</SourceClass> or
  <SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/DataTypes/StripList.cs</SourceClass>
- [Dictionary](https://learn.microsoft.com/cs-cz/dotnet/api/system.collections.idictionary) of extra results indexed by their
  type (`IDictionary<Type,IEvitaResponseExtraResult>`)

The next example documents fetching the second page of products in a category with calculated facet statistics:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Fetching example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/query-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

There are shortcuts for calling query with the expected entity form so that you don't need to declare the expected
entity form in the second argument of the `Query` method:

- `QueryEntityReference` producing <SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/Data/Structure/EntityReference.cs</SourceClass>
- `QuerySealedEntity` producing <SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/Data/ISealedEntity.cs</SourceClass>

#### Lazy fetching (enrichment)

Attributes, associated data, prices and references can be fetched separately by providing the primary key of the entity.
The initial entity loaded by [entity fetch](../../query/requirements/fetching.md) with a limited set of requirements
can be enriched later with missing data.

To enrich, a.k.a. lazy fetch missing data to an existing entity, you must pass the existing entity to an `EnrichEntity`
method and specify a set of additional require constraints that should be satisfied. Due to immutability properties
enforced by database design, enriching an entity object returns a new instance of the entity.

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java">

[Lazy loading example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/lazy-fetch-example.cs)
</SourceCodeTabs>

Lazy fetching may not be necessary for a frontend designed using an MVC architecture, where all requirements for the
page are known before rendering. But different architectures might fetch thinner entity forms and later discover that
they need more data in them. While this approach is not optimal performance-wise, it may make life easier for
developers, and it's much more optimal to just enrich the existing entity (using lookup by primary key and fetching
only missing data) instead of fetching the entire entity again.

<Note type="warning">
Lazy Fetching is currently only fully implemented for embedded evitaDB. If you are using evitaDB remotely via
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/EvitaClient.cs</SourceClass> you can still use the `EnrichEntity` method on the
<SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/EvitaClientSession.cs</SourceClass> instance, but the entity
will be fully fetched again. However, we plan to optimize this scenario in the future.
</Note>

### Caching considerations

If you're using embedded evitaDB and [don't disable the feature](../../operate/configure.md#cache-configuration),
the evitaDB engine automatically caches intermediate calculation results and frequently used entity bodies up to the
defined memory limit. Details about caching are [described here](../../deep-dive/cache.md). For embedded environments

give you better latency. The problem is related to cache invalidation. You'd have to query only the entity references
that contain version information and fetch the entities that are not in the cache with a separate request.
So instead of one network request, you have to make two. The benefit of the local cache is therefore somewhat questionable.

## Defining queries in GraphQL API

In the GraphQL API, the original evitaDB query is split into two places, each with its own syntax:

- query field arguments
  - contains mainly filter and order parts of the original evitaDB query
  - also, may contain requirements that change settings for the query processing and don't directly affect the query output, e.g. `facetGroupsConjuction`
- query output fields
  - by defining output fields, i.e. the data structure to be returned, GraphQL API automatically translates requested fields into evitaDB requirements, so you don't have to specify them manually

Each GraphQL query use some form of the syntax mentioned above. Each [entity collection](/documentation/user/en/use/data-model.md#collection)
has the following GraphQL queries available:

- `getCollecionName`
- `listCollectionName`
- `queryCollectionName`

where the `CollectionName` would be the name of a concrete [entity collection](/documentation/user/en/use/data-model.md#collection), e.g. `queryProduct` or `queryCategory`.

### `get` queries

The `getCollecionName` queries support only a very simplified variant of the filter part of a query, but support fetching of
rich entity objects. As a result, you will only get a specific entity object without unnecessary data around it.
These simplified queries are primarily intended to be used when developing or exploring the API by unique keys,
as they provide quick access to entities.

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL get query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-get-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

#### `getEntity` query

There is also a special variant of the `get` queries with a fixed `entity` classifier in the name -> `getEntity`. This query
is meant to be used when you need to fetch an entity, but you only have a globally unique identifier, and you don't know
the target entity collection.
The query will then return a generic entity object that will contain only data common to all entity collections:

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL get entity query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-get-entity-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

However, you can use the `targetEntity` field to get to the actual entity object (specific to resolved entity collection),
although it comes with a caveat. You need to use [inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments)
to specify field structure for every entity target object you want to support to get actual data:

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL get entity with target entity query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-get-entity-with-target-entity-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

### `list` queries

The `listCollectionName` queries support full filter and order parts of an evitaDB query as a query arguments and fetching
of rich entity objects. As a result, you will get a simple list of entities without having to deal
with the more complex full response with pagination and extra results as you would with of the `queryCollectionName` query.
These queries are meant to be used as a quick way/shortcut to get a list of entities, when no extra results or more advanced pagination
requirements are needed.

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL list query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-list-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

#### `listEntity` query

There is also a special variant of the `list` queries with a fixed `entity` classifier in the name -> `listEntity`. This query
is essentially an extension of the [`getEntity`](#get-entity-query) that accepts multiple identifiers and is meant to be
used when you need to fetch one or more entities, but you only have globally unique identifiers and you don't know the target
entity collection. Also, because the `listEntity` query accepts multiple identifiers, each returned entity can be from
a different entity collection.
The query will then return a list of generic entity objects that contain only data common to all entity collections:

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL list entity query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-list-entity-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

However, you can use the `targetEntity` field to get to the actual entity object (specific to resolved entity collection),
although it comes with a caveat. You need to use [inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments)
to specify field structure for every entity target object you want to support to get actual data:

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[GraphQL list entity with target entity query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/graphql-list-entity-with-target-entity-query-example.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

### `query` queries

The `queryCollectionName` queries are full-featured queries, which are the main queries you should use when
the number of entities is not known in advance or extra results are needed, as they support
all evitaDB query features. Because of all the features, the responses of these queries are more complex than for
the other two query types. However, in addition to entity bodies, you can retrieve pagination metadata and extra results in
one query.

## Defining queries in REST API

In the REST API, there are several entity fetching endpoints that accept evitaQL queries in one form or another. These
endpoints have the following URL forms:

- `/rest/catalog-name/entity-collection/get`
- `/rest/catalog-name/entity-collection/list`
- `/rest/catalog-name/entity-collection/query`

where the `catalog-name` would be the name of a concrete [catalog](/documentation/user/en/use/data-model.md#catalog), and the
`entity-collection` would be the name of a concrete [entity collection](/documentation/user/en/use/data-model.md#collection),
for example `/rest/evita/product/get` or `/rest/evita/category/query`.

### `get` queries

The `/get` endpoints only support a very simplified variant of the filter and requirements part of a query using URL query
parameters. As a result, you will only get a specific entity object without unnecessary data around it.
These simplified endpoints are primarily intended to be used when developing or exploring the API by unique keys,
as they provide quick access to entities.

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[REST get query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/rest-get-query-example.rest)
</SourceCodeTabs>

#### `/entity/get` query

There is also a special variant of the `get` queries with a fixed `entity` classifier -> `/entity/get`. This query
is meant to be used when you need to fetch an entity, but you only have a globally unique identifier and you don't know
the target entity collection.
The query will then return a target entity object based on the resolved entity type of a returned entity:

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>

[REST get entity query example](/documentation/user/en/use/api/example/rest-get-entity-query-example.rest)
</SourceCodeTabs>

### `list` queries

The `/list` endpoints support full filter and order parts of an evitaDB query, but the requirement part is limited only
to fetching entity bodies, not extra results. As a result, you will get a simple list of entities without having to deal
with the more complex full response with pagination and extra results as you would with the `/query` endpoint.
These queries are meant to be used as a quick way/shortcut to get a list of entities, when no extra results or more advanced pagination
requirements are needed.

be used when you need to fetch one or more entities, but you only have globally unique identifiers and you don't know the target
entity collection. Also, because the `/entity/list` query accepts multiple identifiers, each returned entity can be from

the other two endpoint types. However, in additions to entity bodies, you receive pagination metadata and extra results in
one query.
