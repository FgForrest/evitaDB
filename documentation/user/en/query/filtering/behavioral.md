  Special behavioural filter constraint containers are used to define a filter constraint scope, which has a different 
  treatment in calculations, or to define a scope in which the entities are searched.

## In Scope

```evitaql-syntax
scope(
    argument:enum(LIVE|ARCHIVED)
    filterConstraint:any+
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:enum(LIVE|ARCHIVED)</dt>
    <dd>
        mandatory enum argument representing the scope to which the filter constraints in the second and subsequent
        arguments are applied
    </dd>
    <dt>filterConstraint:any+</dt>
    <dd>
        one or more mandatory filter conditions, combined by a logical link, used to filter entities only in 
        a specific scope
    </dd>
</dl>

The `inScope` (<LS to="e,j,r,g"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/filtering/FilterInScope.java</SourceClass></LS>
<LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Filtering/FilterInScope.cs</SourceClass></LS>) filter container is used 
to restrict filter conditions so that they only apply to a specific scope.

The evitaDB query engine is strict about indexes and does not allow you to filter or sort on data (attributes, references,
etc.) for which no index has been prepared in advance (it tries to avoid situations where a full scan would degrade query 
performance). Scopes, on the other hand, allows us to get rid of unnecessary indexes when we know we will not need them 
(archived data is not expected to be queried as extensively as live data) and free up some resources for more important
tasks.

The [scope](#scope) filter constraint allows us to query entities in both scopes at once, which would be impossible if 
we couldn't tell which filter constraint to apply to which scope. The `inScope` container is designed to handle this 
situation.

<Note type="info">

It's obvious that the `inScope` container is not necessary if we are only querying entities in one scope. However, if 
you do use it in this case, it must match the scope of the query. If you use the `inScope` container with the `LIVE` 
scope, but the query is executed in the `ARCHIVED` scope, the engine will return an error.

</Note>


For example, in our demo dataset we have only a few attributes indexed in the archive - namely `url` and `code` and 
a few others. We don't index references, hierarchy or prices in archive scope. If we want to search for entities in both 
scopes and use appropriate filter constraints, we need to use the `inScope` container in the following way:

##### The result of selected entities in multiple scopes
</NoteTitle>

The result contains two entities selected by the URL attribute. The entity in the live scope also satisfies 
the hierarchy and price constraints specified in the `inScope` container. However, these constraints may not be valid 
for the entity in the archive scope, as can be seen by looking at the input query.

Similar `inScope` containers are available for [order constraints](../ordering/behavioral.md#in-scope) 
and [requirements constraints](../requirements/behavioral.md#in-scope) with the same purpose and meaning.

## Scope

```evitaql-syntax
scope(
    argument:enum(LIVE|ARCHIVED)+
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:enum(LIVE|ARCHIVED)+</dt>
    <dd>
        mandatory one or more enum arguments representing the scope to be searched for the result
    </dd>
</dl>

The `scope` (<LS to="e,j,r,g"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/filtering/Scope.java</SourceClass></LS>
<LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Filtering/Scope.cs</SourceClass></LS>) filtering allows you to specify 
the scope in which the result is searched. Two scopes are available:

- `LIVE` - the default scope, which searches the live data for the result
- `ARCHIVED` - the scope that searches for the result in the archived data.

Scopes represent the means how evitaDB handles so called "soft deletes". The application can choose between a hard 
delete and archiving the entity, which simply moves the entity to the archive scope. The details of the archiving 
process are described in the chapter [Archiving](../../use/schema.md#scopes) and the reasons why this feature 
exists are explained in the [dedicated blog post](https://evitadb.io/blog/15-soft-delete).

##### Specific behavior related to unique keys

</NoteTitle>

Unique constraints are only enforced within the same scope. This means that two entities in different scopes can have
the same unique attribute value. When you move an entity from one scope to another, the unique constraints within
the target scope are checked and if the entity violates the unique constraint, the move is refused.

If you query entities in both scopes using [scope](../query/filtering/behavioral.md#scope) filter and use the filtering
constraint that exactly matches the unique attribute ([attribute equals](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-equals),
[attribute in set](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-in-set), [attribute is](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-is)),
evitaDB will prefer the entity from the first scope specified in `scope` constraint over the entities in scopes defined
later in this `scope` constraint. This means that if you query a single entity by its unique attribute value (e.g. `URL`)
and search for the entity in both scopes, you will always get the entity from the first scope you declare in your query.
This behavior is not applied, when only partial match is used (e.g. [attribute starts with](../filtering/string.md#attribute-starts-with), 
etc.).

</Note>

There are a few archived entities in our demo dataset. Our schema is configured to index only the `URL` and `code`
attributes in the archived scope, so we can search for archived entities using only these attributes and, of course, 
the primary key.

##### The result of querying archived entities
</NoteTitle>

</LS>

</Note>

When we need to look up by the `URL` attribute, which is usually unique, there's an important difference, and that is 
that the `URL` is only unique within its scope. This means that the same URL can be used for different entities in 
different scopes. This is the case for some of our entities in our demo data set. The conflict for the unique key 
between different entities is resolved by evitaDB by favouring the live entity over the archived one.

## User filter

```evitaql-syntax
userFilter(
    filterConstraint:any+
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>filterConstraint:any+</dt>
    <dd>
        one or more mandatory filter constraints that will produce logical conjunction
    </dd>
</dl>


The <LS to="e,j,r,g"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/filter/UserFilter.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Filter/UserFilter.cs</SourceClass></LS>
works identically to the [`and`](logical.md#and) constraint, but it distinguishes the filter scope, which is controlled by the user
through some kind of user interface, from the rest of the query, which contains the mandatory constraints on the result
set. The user-defined scope can be modified during certain calculations (such as the [facet](../filtering/facet.md)
or [histogram](../filtering/histogram.md) calculation), while the mandatory part outside of `userFilter` cannot.

Let's look at the example where the [`facetHaving`](references.md#facet-having) constraint is used inside
the `userFilter` container:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

[User filter container example](/documentation/user/en/query/filtering/examples/behavioral/user-filter.evitaql)

</SourceCodeTabs>

And compare it to the situation when we remove the `userFilter` container:

| Facet summary with `facetHaving` in `userFilter`  | Facet summary without `userFilter` scope       |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ![Before](assets/user-filter-before.png "Before") | ![After](assets/user-filter-after.png "After") |

As you can see in the second image, the facet summary is greatly reduced to a single facet option that is selected by
the user. Because the facet is considered a "mandatory" constraint in this case, it behaves the same as
the [`referenceHaving`](references.md#reference-having) constraint, which is combined with other constraints via logical
disjunction. Since there is no other entity that would refer to both the *amazon* brand and another brand (of course,
a product can only have a single brand), the other possible options are automatically removed from the facet summary
because they would produce an empty result set.
