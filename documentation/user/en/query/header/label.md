## Label

```evitaql-syntax
label(
    argument:string!,
    argument:any!
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:string!</dt>
    <dd>
        mandatory string argument representing the name of the label
    </dd>
    <dt>argument:any!</dt>
    <dd>
        mandatory any argument representing the value of the label, 
        any [supported type](../../use/data-types.md#simple-data-types) can be used
    </dd>
</dl>

This `label` constraint allows a single label name with associated value to be specified in the query header and
propagated to the trace generated for the query. A query can be tagged with multiple labels.

Labels are also recorded with the query in the [traffic record](../../operate/observe.md#traffic-recording) and can be
used to look up the query in the traffic inspection or traffic replay. Labels are also attached to JFR events related
to the query.

Each label is a key-value pair appended to the query header, as shown in the following example:

<Note type="info">

You can also provide labels using HTTP request headers in the form of `X-Meta-Label: <label-name>=<label-value>`.
You may set multiple labels by providing multiple `X-Meta-Label` headers in the same request.

There are also automatic labels that are added to the query by the system, such as:

- `client-ip`: the IP address of the client that sent the query (real client IP address can be propagated using the
  [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header)
- `client-uri`: the URI of the client that sent the query, present only if [X-Forwarded-Uri](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Uri) header is present
- `client-id`: the identification of the client - see [clientId](../../use/connectors/java.md#configuration)
- `trace-id`: current trace ID if [tracing](../../operate/observe.md#tracing) is enabled

<LS to="g">If you use GraphQL API there is also `operation-name` label derived from the query name (if any name is defined).</LS>
