Typically, the facet summary is ordered in some way to present the most relevant facet options first. The same is true
for ordering facet groups. To sort the facet summary items the way you like, you can use
the [`orderBy`](../basics.md#order-by) and `orderGroupBy` (which is the same as `orderBy` but it sorts the facet groups
instead of the individual facets) constraints.
