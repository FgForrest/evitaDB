title: Facet filtering
date: '29.10.2023'
perex: |
  Faceted filtering, also known as parameterized filtering, is a user interface feature that allows users to refine
  search results by applying multiple filters based on various properties or "facets" like category, parameter, or
  brand. Users can toggle these filters on or off to drill down into a data set interactively, essentially performing
  real-time complex queries without technical knowledge. The benefits are twofold: First, it improves user experience
  by enabling more targeted and efficient searching. Second, it can increase conversion rates for e-commerce sites by
  helping users quickly find and purchase products that meet their specific criteria.

![Facet filter example](assets/facet-filtering.png "Facet filter example")

The key success factor of faceted search is to help users avoid situations where their filter combination returns no
results. It works best when we gradually limit the facet options that don't make sense with the ones already selected,
and also provide accurate, on-the-spot, real-time feedback about the number of results that will expand or limit
the current selection when another facet is selected.

Facets are usually displayed as a list of checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, or sliders, and are organized into
groups. The options within a group usually expand the current selection (logical disjunction), and the groups are usually
combined with logical conjunction. Some of the facets can be negated (logical negation) to exclude results that match
the facet option.

High cardinality facets are sometimes presented in the form of a search box or interval slider (sometimes with
a [histogram](histogram.md) of the distribution of values) to allow users to specify the exact value or range of values
they are looking for.

evitaDB supports all of the above forms of facet search using the operators documented in this chapter and
in [histogram](histogram.md).

## evitaLab visualization

If you want to get more familiar with the facet summary calculation, you can try to play with the query and see how it affects the visualization tab you can find in our [evitaLab](https://demo.evitadb.io) console:

![Facet summary visualization in the evitaLab console](assets/facet-visualization.png "Facet summary visualization in the evitaLab console")

The visualization is organized in the same way as the facet summary itself:

| ![Total number of results with this facet selected](assets/set-all-custom.png)                | Represents the total number of entities that will be displayed in the result when this facet option is selected (i.e., the number of entities that match the facet option in the entire dataset). )                   |

### Facet calculation rules

1. The facet summary is calculated only for entities that are returned in the current query result (excluding the effect of `userFilter` part of the query if present)
2. The calculation respects any filter constraints placed outside the [`userFilter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter)
   container.
3. The default relation between facets within a group is logical disjunction (logical OR).
4. The default relation between facets in different groups / references is a logical AND.

The request triggers the calculation of the <LS to="j,e,r"><SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/extraResult/FacetSummary.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Models/ExtraResults/FacetSummary.cs</SourceClass></LS>
containing the facet summary calculation. The calculated facet summary will contain all entity references marked as
`faceted` in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md). The facet summary can be further modified by the
[facet summary of reference](#facet-summary-of-reference) constraint, which allows you to override the general facet
summary behavior specified in the generic facet summary require constraint.

</LS>

<LS to="g">

The facet summary can be requested with the `facetSummary` field within extra results. This request triggers the calculation
of the facet summary object, which contains the facet summary calculation.
The calculated facet summary can contain all entity references marked as
`faceted` in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md). The facet summary calculation is requested separately for each reference, so
each reference can have its own behaviour defined.

</LS>

<Note type="warning">

The `faceted` property affects the size of the indexes kept in memory and the scale / complexity of the general facet
summary (i.e. the summary generated by the `facetSummary` request). It is recommended to mark only the references used
for faceted filtering as `faceted` to keep the indexes small and the calculation of the facet summary in the user
interface fast and simple. The combinatorial complexity of the facet summary is quite high for large datasets, and you
may be forced to optimize it by narrowing the summary using the [filtering](#filtering-facet-summary) facility or
selecting only [a few references](#facet-summary-of-reference) for the summary.

</Note>

### Facet summary structure

The facet summary contains only entities referenced by entities returned in the current query response (excluding the
effect of userFilter part of the query if present) and is organized in a three-tier structure:

- **[reference](#1st-tier-reference)**: the top-level contains the names of the references that are marked as `faceted`
  in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md)
- **[facet group](#2nd-tier-facet-group)**: the second-level contains the groups that are specified in
  the returned [entity's references](../../use/data-model.md#references)
- **[facet](#3rd-tier-facet)**: the third-level contains the facet options that represent entities of the returned
  [entity's references](../../use/data-model.md#references)

#### 1st tier: reference

For each entity reference marked as `faceted` in the facet summary, there is a separate data container for collection of
the [2nd-tier facet groups](#2nd-tier-facet-group). If the facets for this reference are not organized in groups
(the reference lacks the group information), the facet summary will contain only one facet group named "non-grouped
facets".

#### 2nd tier: facet group

Facet group lists all [facet options](#3rd-tier-facet) available for the given group and reference combination. It also
contains a `count` of all entities in the current query result that match at least one facet in the group / reference.
<LS to="e,j,c,r">
Optionally, it can contain the body of the group entity if the [`entityGroupFetch`](#entity-group-fetch) requirement is
specified.
</LS>
<LS to="g">
Optionally, it can contain the body of the group entity if the `groupEntity` field is specified.
</LS>

There may also be a special "group" for facets that are not related to a group.

This group will be placed in the facet summary as a `nonGroupedStatistics` property.
</LS>
<LS to="g,r">
This group will be returned as a single group for the reference.
</LS>

#### 3rd tier: facet

Facet contains the statistics for that facet option:

<dl>
  <dt>count</dt>
  <dd>
    It represents the number of all entities in the current query result that match this facet (have reference to entity
    with this primary key).
  </dd>
  <dt>requested</dt>
  <dd>
    `TRUE` if this facet is requested in the [`user filter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter) container of this
    query, `FALSE` otherwise (this property allows you to easily mark the facet checkbox as checked in the user
    interface).
  </dd>
</dl>

<LS to="e,j,c,r">

### Filtering facet summary

The facet summary sometimes gets very big, and besides the fact that it is not very useful to show all facet options in
the user interface, it also takes a lot of time to calculate it.
To limit the facet summary, you can use
the [`filterBy`](../basics.md#filter-by) and `filterGroupBy` (which is the same as `filterBy`, but it filters the entire
facet group instead of individual facets) constraints.

<LS to="g">

The `filterGroupBy` can be specified on each reference field returning facet groups. The `filterBy` can be specified
deeper in the facet summary structure, specifically within the group definition on the `facetStatistics` field, which
returns the actual facet options.

</LS>

<Note type="warning">

<LS to="e,j,c">

If you add the filtering constraints to the `facetSummary` requirement, you can only refer to filterable properties that
are shared by all referenced entities. This may not be feasible in some cases, and you will need to split the generic
`facetSummary` requirement into multiple individual [`facetSummaryOfReference`](#facet-summary-of-reference)
requirements with specific filters for each reference type.

</LS>

<MDInclude>[Behaviour of filtering on referenced entities in facet summary constraint](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/assets/referenced-filter-note.md)</MDInclude>

</Note>

It's hard to find a good example for filtering a generic facet summary even for our demo dataset, so the example will be
a bit artificial. Let's say we want to display only the facet options whose *code* attribute contains the substring
*ar*, and only those that are within groups with *code* starting with the letter *o*:

If you add the ordering constraints to the `facetSummary` requirement, you can only refer to sortable properties that
are shared by all referenced entities. This may not be feasible in some cases, and you will need to split the generic

overrides the default constraints from the generic requirement to constraints specific to this particular reference.
By combining the generic [`facetSummary`](#facet-summary) and `facetSummaryOfReference`, you define common requirements
for the facet summary calculation, and redefine them only for references where they are insufficient.
The `facetSummaryOfReference` requirements redefine all constraints from the generic `facetSummary` requirement.

Let's say we want to display the facet summary for products in the _e-readers_ category, but we want the summary to be
computed only for the `brand` and `parameterValues` references. The facets within the `brand` reference should be
ordered by name in alphabetical order, and the facets within the `parameterValues` reference should be ordered by their
`order` attribute, both at the group level and at the facet level. Only the facets inside facet groups (`parameter`)
with `isVisible` attribute equal to `TRUE` should be calculated for the summary:

### Filtering facet summary

The facet summary sometimes gets very big, and besides the fact that it is not very useful to show all facet options in
the user interface, it also takes a lot of time to calculate it.
To limit the facet summary, you can use
the [`filterBy`](../basics.md#filter-by) and `filterGroupBy` (which is the same as `filterBy`, but it filters the entire
facet group instead of individual facets) constraints.

<Note type="warning">

You can only filter facets and groups using `facetSummaryOfReference` because a filter container is specific to a particular
entity collection, which is not known in advance in the generic `facetSummary`.

<MDInclude>[Behaviour of filtering on referenced entities in facet summary constraint](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/assets/referenced-filter-note.md)</MDInclude>

</Note>

It's hard to find a good example for filtering a generic facet summary even for our demo dataset, so the example will be
a bit artificial. Let's say we want to display only the facet options whose *code* attribute contains the substring
*ar*, and only those that are within groups with *code* starting with the letter *o*:
