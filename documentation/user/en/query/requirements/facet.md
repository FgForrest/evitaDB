title: Facet filtering
date: '29.10.2023'
perex: |
  Faceted filtering, also known as parameterized filtering, is a user interface feature that allows users to refine 
  search results by applying multiple filters based on various properties or "facets" like category, parameter, or 
  brand. Users can toggle these filters on or off to drill down into a data set interactively, essentially performing 
  real-time complex queries without technical knowledge. The benefits are twofold: First, it improves user experience 
  by enabling more targeted and efficient searching. Second, it can increase conversion rates for e-commerce sites by
  helping users quickly find and purchase products that meet their specific criteria.

![Facet filter example](assets/facet-filtering.png "Facet filter example")

The key success factor of faceted search is to help users avoid situations where their filter combination returns no 
results. It works best when we gradually limit the facet options that don't make sense with the ones already selected, 
and also provide accurate, on-the-spot, real-time feedback about the number of results that will expand or limit 
the current selection when another facet is selected.

Facets are usually displayed as a list of checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, or sliders, and are organized into 
groups. The options within a group usually expand the current selection (logical disjunction), and the groups are usually 
combined with logical conjunction. Some of the facets can be negated (logical negation) to exclude results that match 
the facet option.

High cardinality facets are sometimes presented in the form of a search box or interval slider (sometimes with 
a [histogram](histogram.md) of the distribution of values) to allow users to specify the exact value or range of values 
they are looking for.

evitaDB supports all of the above forms of facet search using the operators documented in this chapter and 
in [histogram](histogram.md).

## evitaLab visualization

If you want to get more familiar with the facet summary calculation, you can try to play with the query and see how it affects the visualization tab you can find in our [evitaLab](https://demo.evitadb.io) console:

![Facet summary visualization in the evitaLab console](assets/facet-visualization.png "Facet summary visualization in the evitaLab console")

The visualization is organized in the same way as the facet summary itself:

| ![Total number of results with this facet selected](assets/set-all-custom.png)                | Represents the total number of entities that will be displayed in the result when this facet option is selected (i.e., the number of entities that match the facet option in the entire dataset). )                   |

### Facet calculation rules

1. The facet summary is calculated only for entities that are returned in the current query result (excluding the effect of `userFilter` part of the query if present)
2. The calculation respects any filter constraints placed outside the [`userFilter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter)
   container.
3. The default relation between facets within a group is logical disjunction (logical OR).
4. The default relation between facets in different groups / references is a logical AND.

## Facet summary

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp">

<MDInclude>[Syntax of constraint facetSummary](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/assets/facet-summary-syntax.md)</MDInclude>

The request triggers the calculation of the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/extraResult/FacetSummary.java</SourceClass> 
containing the facet summary calculation. The calculated facet summary will contain all entity references marked as 
`faceted` in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md). The facet summary can be further modified by the 
[facet summary of reference](#facet-summary-of-reference) constraint, which allows you to override the general facet 
summary behavior specified in the generic facet summary require constraint.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">

The facet summary can be requested with the `facetSummary` field within extra results. This request triggers the calculation
of the facet summary object, which contains the facet summary calculation. 
The calculated facet summary can contain all entity references marked as
`faceted` in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md). The facet summary calculation is requested separately for each reference, so
each reference can have its own behaviour defined.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="rest">

<MDInclude>[Syntax of constraint facetSummaryOfReference](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/assets/facet-summary-of-reference-syntax.md)</MDInclude>

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/FacetSummaryOfReference.java</SourceClass>
requirement triggers the calculation of the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/extraResult/FacetSummary.java</SourceClass>
for a specific reference.
The facet summary can be requested for all entity references marked as
`faceted` in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md). The facet summary calculation is requested separately for each reference, so
each reference can have its own behaviour defined.

</LanguageSpecific>

<Note type="warning">

The `faceted` property affects the size of the indexes kept in memory and the scale / complexity of the general facet 
summary (i.e. the summary generated by the `facetSummary` request). It is recommended to mark only the references used 
for faceted filtering as `faceted` to keep the indexes small and the calculation of the facet summary in the user 
interface fast and simple. The combinatorial complexity of the facet summary is quite high for large datasets, and you
may be forced to optimize it by narrowing the summary using the [filtering](#filtering-facet-summary) facility or
selecting only [a few references](#facet-summary-of-reference) for the summary.

</Note>

### Facet summary structure

The facet summary contains only entities referenced by entities returned in the current query response (excluding the 
effect of userFilter part of the query if present) and is organized in a three-tier structure:

- **[reference](#1st-tier-reference)**: the top-level contains the names of the references that are marked as `faceted` 
  in the [entity schema](../../use/schema.md)
- **[facet group](#2nd-tier-facet-group)**: the second-level contains the groups that are specified in 
  the returned [entity's references](../../use/data-model.md#references)
- **[facet](#3rd-tier-facet)**: the third-level contains the facet options that represent entities of the returned 
  [entity's references](../../use/data-model.md#references)

#### 1st tier: reference

For each entity reference marked as `faceted` in the facet summary, there is a separate data container for collection of 
the [2nd-tier facet groups](#2nd-tier-facet-group). If the facets for this reference are not organized in groups
(the reference lacks the group information), the facet summary will contain only one facet group named "non-grouped
facets".

#### 2nd tier: facet group

Facet group lists all [facet options](#3rd-tier-facet) available for the given group and reference combination. It also 
contains a `count` of all entities in the current query result that match at least one facet in the group / reference. 
<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp,rest">
Optionally, it can contain the body of the group entity if the [`entityGroupFetch`](#entity-group-fetch) requirement is
specified.
</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">
Optionally, it can contain the body of the group entity if the `groupEntity` field is specified.
</LanguageSpecific>

There may also be a special "group" for facets that are not related to a group.
<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp">
This group will be placed in the facet summary as a `nonGroupedStatistics` property.
</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql,rest">
This group will be returned as a single group for the reference.
</LanguageSpecific>

#### 3rd tier: facet

Facet contains the statistics for that facet option:

<dl>
  <dt>count</dt>
  <dd>
    It represents the number of all entities in the current query result that match this facet (have reference to entity 
    with this primary key).
  </dd>
  <dt>requested</dt>
  <dd>
    `TRUE` if this facet is requested in the [`user filter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter) container of this 
    query, `FALSE` otherwise (this property allows you to easily mark the facet checkbox as checked in the user 
    interface).
  </dd>
</dl>

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp,rest">
And optionally the body of the facet (referenced) entity if the [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) requirement is specified.
If the `IMPACT` statistics depth is requested in the facet summary, the statistics will also include the impact analysis 
calculation, which contains the following data:

<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">
And optionally the body of the facet (referenced) entity if the `facetEntity` field is specified.
If the `impact` object is requested in the facet summary, the statistics will also include the impact analysis

</LanguageSpecific>

<dl>
  <dt>matchCount</dt>
  <dd>
    It represents the number of all entities that would match a new query derived from the current query if this 
    particular facet option were selected (has reference to entity with this primary key). The current query is left 
    intact, including the [`user filter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter) part, but a new facet query is 
    virtually added to the user filter to calculate the hypothetical impact of selecting the facet option.
  </dd>
  <dt>difference</dt>
  <dd>
    It represents the difference between the `matchCount` (hypothetical result should this facet be selected) and 
    the current number of entities returned. It represents the size of the impact on the current result. It can be 
    either positive (the facet option would expand the current result) or negative (the facet option would limit 
    the current result). The difference can be `0` if the facet option doesn't change the current result.
  </dd>
  <dt>hasSense</dt>
  <dd>
    `TRUE` if the facet option combined with the current query still returns some results (matchCount > 0), `FALSE`
    otherwise. This property allows you to easily mark the facet checkbox as "disabled" in the user interface.

The facet summary makes little sense without the bodies of the facet groups and facets. To get those bodies, you need to 
add [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) or [`entityGroupFetch`](#entity-group-fetch) requirement to the query. Let's modify 
the example to fetch the facet summary along with the codes of the facets and their groups:

of the facets and their respective groups:

</Note>

### Filtering facet summary

The facet summary sometimes gets very big, and besides the fact that it is not very useful to show all facet options in 
the user interface, it also takes a lot of time to calculate it.
To limit the facet summary, you can use 
the [`filterBy`](../basics.md#filter-by) and `filterGroupBy` (which is the same as `filterBy`, but it filters the entire
facet group instead of individual facets) constraints.

<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">

The `filterGroupBy` can be specified on each reference field returning facet groups. The `filterBy` can be specified 
deeper in the facet summary structure, specifically within the group definition on the `facetStatistics` field, which 
returns the actual facet options.

</LanguageSpecific>

<Note type="warning">

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp">

If you add the filtering constraints to the `facetSummary` requirement, you can only refer to filterable properties that
are shared by all referenced entities. This may not be feasible in some cases, and you will need to split the generic 
`facetSummary` requirement into multiple individual [`facetSummaryOfReference`](#facet-summary-of-reference) 
requirements with specific filters for each reference type.

</LanguageSpecific>

The filter conditions can only target properties on the target entity and cannot target reference attributes in 
the source entity that are specific to a relationship with the target entity.

</Note>

It's hard to find a good example for filtering a generic facet summary even for our demo dataset, so the example will be
a bit artificial. Let's say we want to display only the facet options whose *code* attribute contains the substring 
*ar*, and only those that are within groups with *code* starting with the letter *o*:

We don't limit the search to a specific hierarchy because the filter is quite selective, as you can see in the result:

</LanguageSpecific>

</Note>

### Ordering facet summary

Typically, the facet summary is ordered in some way to present the most relevant facet options first. The same is true 
for ordering facet groups. To sort the facet summary items the way you like, you can use 
the [`orderBy`](../basics.md#order-by) and `orderGroupBy` (which is the same as `orderBy` but it sorts the facet groups
instead of the individual facets) constraints.
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">
The `orderGroupBy` can be specified on each reference field returning facet groups. The `orderBy` can be specified 
deeper in the facet summary structure, specifically inside the group definition on `facetStatistics` field returning actual
facet options.
</LanguageSpecific>

<Note type="warning">

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp">

If you add the ordering constraints to the `facetSummary` requirement, you can only refer to sortable properties that 
are shared by all referenced entities. This may not be feasible in some cases, and you will need to split the generic 
`facetSummary` requirement into multiple individual [`facetSummaryOfReference`](#facet-summary-of-reference) 
requirements with specific ordering constraints for each reference type.

</LanguageSpecific>

The ordering constraints can only target properties on the target entity and cannot target reference attributes in 
the source entity that are specific to a relationship with the target entity.

</Note>

Let's sort both facet groups and facets alphabetically by their English names:

## Facet summary of reference

<MDInclude>[Syntax of constraint facetSummaryOfReference](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/assets/facet-summary-of-reference-syntax.md)</MDInclude>

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/FacetSummaryOfReference.java</SourceClass> 
requirement triggers the calculation of the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/extraResult/FacetSummary.java</SourceClass> 
for a specific reference. When a generic [`facetSummary`](#facet-summary) requirement is specified, this require constraint 
overrides the default constraints from the generic requirement to constraints specific to this particular reference. 
By combining the generic [`facetSummary`](#facet-summary) and `facetSummaryOfReference`, you define common requirements 
for the facet summary calculation, and redefine them only for references where they are insufficient. 
The `facetSummaryOfReference` requirements redefine all constraints from the generic `facetSummary` requirement.

Let's say we want to display the facet summary for products in the _e-readers_ category, but we want the summary to be 
computed only for the `brand` and `parameterValues` references. The facets within the `brand` reference should be 
ordered by name in alphabetical order, and the facets within the `parameterValues` reference should be ordered by their 
`order` attribute, both at the group level and at the facet level. Only the facets inside facet groups (`parameter`) 
with `isVisible` attribute equal to `TRUE` should be calculated for the summary:

</NoteTitle>

As you can see, this is a fairly complex scenario that uses all the key features of the facet summary calculation:

## Entity group fetch

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,csharp,rest">

The `entityGroupFetch` constraint used within the [`facetSummary`](#facet-summary) or 
[`facetSummaryOfReference`](#facet-summary-of-reference) requirement is identical to 
the [`entityFetch`](fetching.md#entity-fetch) requirement described in the referenced chapter. The only difference is
that the `entityGroupFetch` refers to the related group entity schema specified by the faceted 
[reference schema](../../use/schema.md#reference), and is named `entityGroupFetch` instead of `entityFetch` to 
distinguish the requirements for referenced (facet) entity and referenced (facet) entity group.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">

The `groupEntity` field used within the facet group object in the [`facetSummary`](#facet-summary) has same meaning
as [standard entity fetching](fetching.md#entity-fetch). The only difference is
that the `groupEntity` refers to the related group entity schema specified by the faceted
[reference schema](../../use/schema.md#reference).

## Facet groups conjunction

```evitaql-syntax
facetGroupsConjunction(
    argument:string!,
    filterConstraint:filterBy
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:string!</dt>
    <dd>
        Mandatory argument specifying the name of the [reference](../../use/schema.md#reference) to which this 
        constraint refers.
    </dd>
    <dt>filterConstraint:filterBy</dt>
    <dd>
        Optional filter constraint that selects one or more facet groups whose facets will be combined with logical AND 
        instead of the default logical OR.

        If the filter is not defined, the behavior applies to all groups of a given reference in the facet summary.
    </dd>
</dl>

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/FacetGroupsConjunction.java</SourceClass> 
changes the default behavior of the facet summary calculation for the facet groups specified in the `filterBy` 
constraint. Instead of logical disjunction (logical OR), the facet options in the facet groups are combined with logical 
conjunction (logical AND).

To understand the difference between the default behavior and the behavior of this requirement, let's compare the facet 
summary calculation for the same query with and without this requirement. We will need a query that targets some 
reference (let's say `groups`) and pretend that the user has already requested (checked) some of the facets. If we now 
want to calculate the `IMPACT` analysis for the rest of the facets in the group, we will see that changing the default
behavior changes the numbers produced:

</SourceCodeTabs>

<Note type="info">

Note that the `facetGroupsConjunction` in the example doesn't contain a `filterBy` constraint, so it applies to all
the facet groups in the facet summary, or in this particular case to facets in the reference `groups` that are not
part of any group.

You can see that instead of increasing the number of results in the final set, the impact analysis predicts their
reduction:

## Facet groups disjunction

```evitaql-syntax
facetGroupsDisjunction(
    argument:string!,
    filterConstraint:filterBy
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:string!</dt>
    <dd>

        constraint refers.
    </dd>
    <dt>filterConstraint:filterBy</dt>
    <dd>
        Optional filter constraint that selects one or more facet groups whose facet options will be combined with logical 
        disjunction (logical OR) with facets of different groups instead of the default logical conjunction (logical 
        AND). 

        If the filter is not defined, the behavior applies to all groups of a given reference in the facet summary.
    </dd>
</dl>

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/FacetGroupsDisjunction.java</SourceClass> 
changes the default behavior of the facet summary calculation for the facet groups specified in the `filterBy` constraint. 
Instead of logical AND, the facet options in the facet groups are combined with logical OR with facets from different
facet groups.

To understand the difference between the default behavior and the behavior of this constraint, let's compare the facet 
summary calculation for the same query with and without this constraint. We will need a query that targets some 
reference (let's say `parameterValues`) and pretend that the user has already requested (checked) some of the facets.
Now, if we want to calculate the `IMPACT` analysis for the other group in the facet summary, we will see that instead of 
reducing the numbers, the impact analysis predicts their expansion:

## Facet groups negation

```evitaql-syntax
facetGroupsNegation(
    argument:string!,
    filterConstraint:filterBy
)

<dl>

    <dd>

        constraint refers.
    </dd>
    <dt>filterConstraint:filterBy</dt>
    <dd>
        Optional filter constraint that selects one or more facet groups whose facet options are negated. Thus, instead 
        of returning only those items that reference that particular faceted entity, the query result will return only 
        those items that don't reference it.

        If the filter is not defined, the behavior applies to all groups of a particular reference in the facet summary.
    </dd>
</dl>

The <SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/FacetGroupsNegation.java</SourceClass> changes 
the behavior of the facet option in all facet groups specified in the `filterBy` constraint. Instead of returning only 
those items that have a reference to that particular faceted entity, the query result will return only those items that
don't have a reference to it.

To demonstrate this effect, we need a query that targets some reference (let's say `parameterValues`) and makes some of 
the listed group as negated.

##### The result of facet summarization with negated facet relation behavior in the group

The predicted results in the negated groups are far greater than the numbers produced by the default behavior. As you 
can see, selecting any option in the RAM facet group predicts returning thousands of results, while the ROM facet group
with default behavior predicts only a dozen of them:
