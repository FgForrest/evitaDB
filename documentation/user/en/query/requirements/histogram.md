    Histograms serve a pivotal role in e-commerce parametrized filtering by visually representing the distribution of
    product attributes, enabling customers to adjust their search criteria efficiently. They facilitate a more
    interactive and precise filtering experience, allowing users to modify the range of properties like price or size
    based on actual item availability.

There are actually only a few use cases in e-commerce websites where histograms are used. The most common is the price
histogram, which is used to filter products by price. You can see an example of such a histogram on the Booking.com
website:

![Booking.com price histogram filter](assets/price-histogram.png "Booking.com price histogram filter")

It's a shame that the histogram isn't used more often, because it's a very useful tool for gaining insight into
the distribution of product attributes with high cardinality values such as weight, height, width and so on.

The histogram data structure is optimized for frontend rendering. It contains the following fields:

- **`min`** - the minimum value of the attribute in the current filter context
- **`max`** - the maximum value of the attribute in the current filter context
- **`overallCount`** - the number of elements whose attribute value falls into any of the buckets (it's basically a sum of all bucket occurrences)
- **`buckets`** - an *sorted* array of buckets, each of which contains the following fields:
  - **`threshold`** - the minimum value of the attribute in the bucket, the maximum value is the threshold of the next bucket (or `max` for the last bucket)
  - **`occurrences`** - the number of elements whose attribute value falls into the bucket
  - **`requested`**:
    - contains `true` if the query didn't contain any [attributeBetween](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-between)
      or [priceBetween](../filtering/price.md#price-between) constraints
    - contains `true` if the query contained [attributeBetween](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-between)
      or [priceBetween](../filtering/price.md#price-between) constraint for particular attribute / price
      and the bucket threshold lies within the range (inclusive) of the constraint
    - contains `false` otherwise

## Attribute histogram

<LS to="e,j,r,c">

```evitaql-syntax
attributeHistogram(
    argument:int!,
    argument:enum(STANDARD|OPTIMIZED),
    argument:string+
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:int!</dt>
    <dd>
        the number of columns (buckets) in the histogram; number should be chosen so that the histogram fits well
        into the available space on the screen
    </dd>

    <dd>
        The behavior of the histogram calculation - either STANDARD (default), where exactly the requested number of
        buckets is returned, or OPTIMIZED, where the number of columns is reduced when the data is sparse and there
        would be large gaps (empty buckets) between buckets. This results in more compact histograms that provide
        a better user experience.

<LS to="g,r">attribute histogram</LS>
can be computed from any [filterable attribute](../../use/data-model.md#attributes-unique-filterable-sortable-localized)
whose type is numeric. The histogram is computed only from the attributes of elements that match the current mandatory
part of the filter. The interval related constraints - i.e. [`attributeBetween`](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-between)
and [`priceBetween`](../filtering/price.md#price-between) in the [`userFilter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter)
part are excluded for the sake of histogram calculation. If this weren't the case, the user narrowing the filtered range
based on the histogram results would be driven into a narrower and narrower range and eventually into a dead end.

To demonstrate the use of the histogram, we will use the following example:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

[Attribute histogram over `width` and `height` attributes](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/histogram/attribute-histogram.evitaql)

</SourceCodeTabs>

The simplified result looks like this:

<MDInclude sourceVariable="extraResults.AttributeHistogram">[The result of `width` and `height` attribute histogram](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/histogram/attribute-histogram.evitaql.string.md)</MDInclude>

<Note type="info">

The histogram result in JSON format is a bit more verbose, but it's still quite readable:

### Attribute histogram contents optimization

During user testing, we found that histograms with scarce data are not very useful. Besides the fact that they don't
look good, they are often harder to manipulate with the widget that controls the histogram and tries to stick to
the bucket thresholds. Therefore, we have introduced a new histogram calculation mode - `OPTIMIZED`. In this mode,
the histogram calculation algorithm tries to reduce the number of buckets when the data is sparse and there would be
large gaps (empty buckets) between buckets. This results in more compact histograms that provide a better user
experience.

To demonstrate the optimization of the histogram, we will use the following example:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

[Optimized attribute histogram over `width` attribute](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/histogram/attribute-histogram-optimized.evitaql)

</SourceCodeTabs>

The simplified result looks like this:

<MDInclude sourceVariable="extraResults.AttributeHistogram">[The result of optimized `width` attribute histogram](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/histogram/attribute-histogram-optimized.evitaql.string.md)</MDInclude>

<Note type="info">

<NoteTitle toggles="true">

As you can see, the number of buckets has been adjusted to fit the data, contrary to the default behavior.

## Price histogram

is computed from the [price for sale](../filtering/price.md). The interval related constraints - i.e.
[`attributeBetween`](../filtering/comparable.md#attribute-between) and [`priceBetween`](../filtering/price.md#price-between)
in the [`userFilter`](../filtering/behavioral.md#user-filter) part are excluded for the sake of histogram calculation.
If this weren't the case, the user narrowing the filtered range based on the histogram results would be driven into
a narrower and narrower range and eventually into a dead end.

The [`priceType`](price.md#price-type) requirement the source price property for the histogram computation. If no
requirement, the histogram visualizes the price with tax.
