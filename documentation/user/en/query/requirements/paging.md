title: Paging
perex: |
  Paging request constraints help to traverse large lists of records by splitting them into several parts that are requested
  separately. This technique is used to reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and to reduce the load
  on the server. evitaDB supports several ways to paginate query results, which are described in this section.

In GraphQL, there are multiple different ways to paginate results. The main distinction is between the
[`list` queries](../../use/api/query-data.md#list-queries) and [`query` queries](../../use/api/query-data.md#query-queries).
The `query` queries are then further divided into `page` and `strip` pagination.

## Pagination of `list` queries

As mentioned in [detailed description of `list` queries](../../use/api/query-data.md#list-queries), the `list` queries
are meant to be used for quick listing of entities, and so they offer only a limited set of pagination features.

The pagination is controlled by the `limit` and `offset` arguments on a `listCollectionName` field, and it doesn't provide
any pagination metadata (e.g., total number of records, page number, and so on):

##### The result of list query pagination example
</NoteTitle>

The result contains the result from the 11th through the 15th record of the listing result. It returns only a primary key
of the records because no content request was specified, and it is sorted by the primary key in ascending order because
no order was specified in the query.

## Pagination of `query` queries

The fully-featured [`query` queries](../../use/api/query-data.md#query-queries) support fully-featured pagination.
The pagination in this case has two versions - `page` (`recordPage` field) and `strip` (`recordStrip` field), and both provide pagination metadata.

### Page (`recordPage`)

pages, a result with the first page is returned. An empty result is only returned if the query returns no result at all
or the page size is set to zero. By automatically returning the first page result when the requested page is exceeded,
we try to avoid the need to issue a secondary request to fetch the data.

The information about the actual returned page and data statistics can be found in the query response, which is wrapped
in a so-called data chunk object. <LS to="e,j,r,c">In case of the `page` constraint,

The <LS to="e,j,r,c">`page` requirement</LS><LS to="g">`recordPage` field</LS>
is the most natural and commonly used requirement for the pagination of the query results.
To get the second page of the query result, use the following query:

The result contains the result from the 6th through the 10th record of the query result. It returns only a primary key
of the records because no content request was specified, and it is sorted by the primary key in ascending order because
no order was specified in the query.

The `strip` requirement can be used to list query records in a non-uniform way - for example, when the entity listing is
interleaved with an advertisement that requires an entity rendering to be skipped at certain positions. In other words,
if you know that there is an "advertisement" block every 20 records, which means that the entity must be skipped for
that position, and you want to correctly fetch records for the 5th page, you need to request a strip with offset `76`
(4 pages * 20 positions per page - 4 records omitted on the previous 4 pages) and limit 19. To get such a strip, use
the following query:

##### The result of requested strip example
</NoteTitle>

The result contains the result from the 76th through the 95th record of the query result. It returns only a primary key
of the records because no content request was specified, and it is sorted by the primary key in ascending order because
no order was specified in the query.
