title: Fetching
perex: |
  Fetch request constraints help control the amount of data returned in the query response. This technique is used to
  reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and to reduce the load on the server. Fetching is similar to
  joins and column selection in SQL, but is inspired by data fetching in the GraphQL protocol by incrementally following
  the relationships in the data.

If no content requirement is used in the query, the result will contain only the primary key of the entity. While this
may be sufficient for some queries, it is usually necessary to fetch some data from the entity or even other entities
related to the entity. For this purpose, the [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) request and nested *content* requests
described in this section are used:

## Entity content

The simplest data you can fetch with an entity is its primary key and type. These are returned by evitaDB with every query,
no matter how rich you requested the entity to be.

either by using the [`entityLocaleEquals`](../filtering/locale.md#entity-locale-equals) filter constraint or

the data in a specific locale, which means you will use the `dataInLocales` requirement with a single locale

## Hierarchy content

<dl>

        optional one or more constraints that allow you to define the completeness of the hierarchy entities and
        the scope of the traversed hierarchy tree;
        any or both of the constraints may be present:
        <ul>
            <li>[entityFetch](fetching.md#entity-fetch)</li>
            <li>[stopAt](hierarchy.md#stop-at)</li>

The `hierarchyContent` (<LS to="e,j,r"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/HierarchyContent.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Requires/HierarchyContent.cs</SourceClass></LS>)
requirement allows you to access the information about the hierarchical placement of the entity.

If no additional constraints are specified, entity will contain a full chain of parent primary keys up to the root of
a hierarchy tree. You can limit the size of the chain by using a `stopAt` constraint - for example, if you're only
interested in a direct parent of each entity returned, you can use a `stopAt(distance(1))` constraint. The result is
similar to using a [`parents`](hierarchy.md#parents) constraint, but is limited in that it doesn't provide information
about statistics and the ability to list siblings of the entity parents. On the other hand, it's easier to use - since
the hierarchy placement is directly available in the retrieved entity object.

If you provide a nested [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) constraint, the hierarchy information will contain the bodies of
the parent entities in the required width. The [`attributeContent`](#attribute-content) inside the `entityFetch` allows
you to access the attributes of the parent entities, etc.

To fetch an entity with basic hierarchy information, use the following query:

<LS to="g">

To access the information about the hierarchical placement of an entity, use either the `parentPrimaryKey` or the `parents` field (or both).

The `parentPrimaryKey` field returns only the primary key of the direct parent of the entity. If the entity has no parent
(i.e. it's a root entity), the field returns `null`.

The `parents` fields allows you to access the entire chain of parent entities up to the root of a hierarchy tree. Inside
you can use standard entity fields besides the `parents` field for the fetched parent entities. If no additional arguments
are specified the list will contain a entire chain of parent entities up to the root of a hierarchy tree. You can limit the
size of the chain by using a `stopAt` argument - for example, if you're only interested in a direct parent of each entity
returned, you can use a `stopAt: { distance: 1 }` argument. The arguments takes special require constraints to specify
on which node to stop the hierarchy traversal.
The result is similar to using a [`parents`](hierarchy.md#parents) requirement, but is limited in that it doesn't provide
information about statistics and the ability to list siblings of the entity parents. On the other hand, it's easier to
use - since the hierarchy placement is directly available in the retrieved entity object.

        enum allowing you to specify whether to fetch all, selected or no price records for the entity:

        - **NONE**: no prices will be fetched for the entity (even if the filter contains a price constraint)
        - **RESPECTING_FILTER**: only a prices in price lists selected by a filter constraint will be fetched
        - **ALL**: all prices of the entity will be fetched (regardless of the price constraint in a filter)

    </dd>

    <dd>
        optional one or more string arguments representing price list names to add to the list of price lists passed in
        a filter price constraint, which together form a set of price lists for which to fetch prices for the entity
    </dd>
</dl>

The `priceContent` (<LS to="e,j,r"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/PriceContent.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Requires/PriceContent.cs</SourceClass></LS>)
requirement allows you to access the information about the prices of the entity.

If the `RESPECTING_FILTER` mode is used, the `priceContent` requirement will only retrieve the prices selected by
the [`priceInPriceLists`](../filtering/price.md#price-in-price-lists) constraint. If the enum `NONE` is specified, no
prices are returned at all, if the enum `ALL` is specified, all prices of the entity are returned regardless of the
`priceInPriceLists` constraint in the filter (the constraint still controls whether the entity is returned at all).

You can also add additional price lists to the list of price lists passed in the `priceInPriceLists` constraint by
specifying the price list names as string arguments to the `priceContent` requirement. This is useful if you want to
fetch non-indexed prices of the entity that cannot (and are not intended to) be used to filter the entities, but you
still want to fetch them to display in the UI for the user.

<LS to="r">

For entities that have either `LOWEST_PRICE` or `SUM` inner record handling, the `multiplePricesForSaleAvailable` 
property is returned, indicating whether there are multiple _unique_ prices for sale (grouped by the `innerRecordId`). 
It is important to note that it doesn't simply return the count of all prices for sale.
Instead, it uses the [`priceType`](../requirements/price.md#price-type) constraint to determine the uniqueness of each
price value. This means that even if there are, say, 3 prices for sale, but they all have the same value, this property
will return `false`. This is especially useful for the
UI to determine whether to display a price range or just a single price without having to fetch all prices for sale.

requirement allows you to access the information about the prices of the entity. It fetches only the prices selected by
the [`priceInPriceLists`](../filtering/price.md#price-in-price-lists) constraint.

You can also add additional price lists to the list of price lists passed in the `priceInPriceLists` constraint by
specifying the price list names as string arguments to the `priceContent` requirement. This is useful if you want to
fetch non-indexed prices of the entity that cannot (and are not intended to) be used to filter the entities, but you
still want to fetch them to display in the UI for the user.

requirement allows you to access all of the entity's price information regardless of the filtering constraints specified
in the query.

This requirement is only a variation of the generic [`priceContent`](#price-content) requirement.

As you can see, all prices of the entity are returned in all available currencies - not only the filtered price lists
*employee-basic-price* and *basic*. Thanks to `priceContentAll` you have an overview of all prices of the entity.

</Note>

</LS>
<LS to="g">

To fetch price information for an entity, there are several different fields available within an entity: `priceForSale`, 
`allPricesForSale`, `multiplePricesForSaleAvailable`, `price` and `prices`.
Each has a different purpose and returns different information.

The price object returns various data that can be formatted by the server for you to display to the user. Specifically,
the actual price numbers within the price object can be retrieved formatted according to the specified locale and can even
include the currency symbol. This is controlled by the `formatted` and `withCurrency` arguments on the respective price object fields.
The locale is either resolved from the context of the query
(either from a localized unique attribute in the filter or from the `entityLocaleEquals` constraint in the filter) or can be specified
directly on the parent price field by the `locale` argument.

### Prices for sale

The `priceForSale` field returns a single price object representing the price for sale of the entity.
By default, this price is [computed based on input filter constraints](../filtering/price.md), more specifically:
`priceInPriceLists`, `priceInCurrency` and `priceValidIn`. This is expected to be the most common use case, as
it also filters returned entities by these conditions.

As you can see, the price for sale matching the filter constraints is returned.

</Note>

Alternatively, if you don't want to filter entities by the price filter constraints, but you still want to compute and fetch
specific price for sale, you can specify which price for sale you want to compute by using the `priceList`, `currency` and
`validIn`/`validNow` arguments directly on the `priceForSale` field. You can even combine these two approaches,
in which case the arguments on the `priceForSale` fields simply override the corresponding price constraints used in the filter.
Theoretically, you can then filter entities by different price conditions than you use to compute the returned price for sale.

As you can see, the price for sale matching the custom arguments is returned.

</Note>

Similarly, you can use `allPricesForSale`, which is almost the same as `priceForSale`, but returns all prices for sale
of the entity grouped by the `innerRecordId`. This usually only makes sense for master products with variants 
(i.e. `LOWEST_PRICE` inner record handling) where the master product has prices for all of its variants, where you may 
want to know (and display) prices for sale for each variant (or some kind of range). For the `NONE` inner record handling,
this will always return at most the actual single price for sale. For the `SUM` inner record handling, this will return prices for sale
for each `innerRecordId` in the same way as for the `FIRST_OCCURNCE`, but the use cases are limited.

The returned list of prices is sorted by the price value from the lowest to the highest depending on the [`priceType`](../requirements/price.md#price-type)
constraint used.

There is also the simpler `multiplePricesForSaleAvailable` field, which returns a boolean indicating whether there are 
multiple _unique_ prices for sale. It is important to note that it doesn't simply return the count of `allPricesForSale`. 
Instead, it uses the [`priceType`](../requirements/price.md#price-type) constraint to determine the uniqueness of each 
price value. This means that even if there are, say, 3 prices for sale, but they all have the same value, this field 
will return `false` (as opposed to `allPricesForSale`, which would return all prices). This is especially useful for the 
UI to determine whether to display a price range or just a single price without having to fetch all prices for sale.

flag indicating that there are multiple prices for sale available.

</Note>

### Accompanying prices

There may be times when you need not only the concrete [price for sale](#prices-for-sale), but also it's accompanying prices, e.g.
reference price (usually not sellable, but displayed for comparison because it's usually higher than the price for sale). 
This calculation becomes quite complex when we need to handle prices with different inner record handling 
([LOWEST_PRICE, SUM](https://evitadb.io/documentation/query/filtering/price#price-for-sale-selection-in-a-nutshell)).
In such cases, the accompanying prices must correctly reflect the prices for sale for each inner record.

You can easily calculate these prices with the `accompanyingPrice` field within the `priceForSale` or `allPricesForSale` fields.
This way the requested accompanying price will always refer to the parent price for sale (even a custom one). The only 
possible argument is `priceLists`, which defines for which price lists the accompanying price should be calculated 
(the order of the price lists defines a priority in the same way as for the `priceForSale` and `allPricesForSale` fields).
Other parameters will be inherited from the parent price for sale request.

The following query requests calculation of price for sale as well as a reference price for the calculated price for sale:

    </dd>
</dl>

The `referenceContent` (<LS to="e,j,r,g"><SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/ReferenceContent.java</SourceClass></LS><LS to="c"><SourceClass>EvitaDB.Client/Queries/Requires/ReferenceContent.cs</SourceClass></LS>)
requirement allows you to access the information about the references the entity has towards other entities (either
managed by evitaDB itself or by any other external system). This variant of `referenceContent` doesn't return
the attributes set on the reference itself - if you need those attributes, use the [`referenceContentWithAttributes`](#reference-content-with-attributes)
variant of it.

</LS>
<LS to="g">

Reference fields allow you to access the information about the references the entity has towards other entities (either
managed by evitaDB itself or by any other external system). However, reference fields are a bit different from the other
entity fields. They are dynamically generated based on the reference schemas, so you can access them directly from
the entity object by a schema-defined name, and also, each reference object has a slightly different structure based on
the specific reference schema.

To get an entity with reference to categories and brand, use the following query:

#### Referenced entity (group) fetching

In many scenarios, you'll need to fetch not only the primary keys of the referenced entities, but also their bodies and
the bodies of the groups the references refer to. One such common scenario is fetching the parameters of a product:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies and group bodies](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentBodies.rest.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>

The example lists only a *code* attribute for each referenced entity and group for brevity, but you can retrieve any of
their content - associated data, prices, hierarchies, or nested references as well.

</Note>

To demonstrate graph-like fetching of multiple referenced levels, let's fetch a product with its group assignment and
for each group fetch the group's tags and for each tag fetch the tag's category name. The query contains 4 levels of
related entities: product ‚Üí group ‚Üí tag ‚Üí tag category. The query looks like this:

The returned `Product` entity will contain a list of all groups it references, for each group a list of all its tags and

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies and group bodies](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentNested.rest.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>

The tag category is not an entity managed by evitaDB and that's why we retrieve only its primary key.

</Note>

<LS to="g">

#### Reference attributes fetching

Besides fetching the referenced entity bodies, you can also fetch the attributes set on the reference itself. Attributes
of each reference can be fetched using `attributes` field where all possible attributes of particular reference are
available, similarly to entity attributes.

To obtain an entity with reference to a parameter value that reveals which association defines the unique product-variant
combination and which parameter values are merely informative, use the following query:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

[Getting entity with references and their attributes](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentWithAttributes.graphql)

<Note type="info">

<NoteTitle toggles="true">

##### The result of an entity fetched with parameter references and their attributes

The returned `Product` entity will contain references to parameter values and for each of it, it specifies the type
of the relation between the product and the parameter value:

<LS to="g">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="data.queryProduct.recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with all references](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentWithAttributes.graphql.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>

As you can see, the *cellular-true*, *display-size-10-2*, *ram-memory-4*, *rom-memory-256* and *color-yellow* parameter
values define the product variant, while the other parameters only describe the additional properties of the product.

</Note>

</LS>

#### Filtering references

Sometimes your entities have a lot of references and you don't need all of them in certain scenarios. In this case, you
can use the filter constraint to filter out the references you don't need.

<Note type="info">

The <LS to="e,j,r,c">`referenceContent`</LS> filter
<LS to="g">on reference fields</LS>
implicitly targets the attributes on the same reference it points to, so you don't need to
specify a [`referenceHaving`](../filtering/references.md#reference-having) constraint. However, if you need to declare
constraints on referenced entity attributes, you must wrap them in the [`entityHaving`](../filtering/references.md#entity-having)
container constraint.

</Note>

For example, your product has got a lot of parameters, but on product detail page you need to fetch only those that are
part of group which contains an attribute *isVisibleInDetail* set to *TRUE*.To fetch only those parameters, use the
following query:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>

[Getting entity parameter values visible on detail page](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentFilter.evitaql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

<Note type="info">

<NoteTitle toggles="true">

##### The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies that belong to group visible on detail page
</NoteTitle>

The returned `Product` entity will contain a list of all parameter codes it references and the code of the group to
which each parameter belongs:

<LS to="e,j,c">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies that belong to group visible on detail page](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentFilter.evitaql.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>
<LS to="g">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="data.queryProduct.recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies that belong to group visible on detail page](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentFilter.graphql.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>
<LS to="r">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetched with referenced parameter bodies that belong to group visible on detail page](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/referenceContentFilter.rest.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LS>

As you can see only the parameters of the groups having *isVisibleInDetail* set to *TRUE* are returned.

</Note>

#### Ordering references

By default, the references are ordered by the primary key of the referenced entity. If you want to order the references
by a different property - either the attribute set on the reference itself or the property of the referenced entity -
you can use the order constraint inside the `referenceContent` requirement.

<Note type="info">

The <LS to="e,j,r,c">`referenceContent`</LS> ordering
<LS to="g">on reference fields</LS> implicitly targets the attributes on the same reference
it points to, so you don't need to specify a [`referenceProperty`](../ordering/reference.md#reference-property) constraint.
However, if you need to declare
constraints on referenced entity attributes, you must wrap them in the [`entityProperty`](../ordering/reference.md#entity-property)
container constraint.

</Note>

Let's say you want your parameters to be ordered by an English name of the parameter. To do this, use the following
query:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>
