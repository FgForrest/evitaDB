title: Monitor
perex: |
  evitaDB's monitoring facilities are designed to help you monitor running evitaDB instances as well as to help you 
  optimise your application during development. All monitoring facilities are based on our operational experience and 
  development of e-commerce projects.

**Work in progress**

This article will contain description of Evita monitoring facilities - would it be directly Prometheus or OpenTelemetry.
There should be also information how to log slow queries or see other problems within application (logging).
The functionality is not finalized - [see issue #18](https://github.com/FgForrest/evitaDB/issues/18).

## Logging

evitaDB uses the [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) logging facade for logging both application log messages and access log messages. By default
only application log messages are enabled, the access log messages must be explicitly [enabled in configuration](#access-log).

### Access log

If the `accessLog` property is set to `true` in the [configuration](configure.md#api-configuration), the server will log 
access log messages for all APIs using the
[Slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) logging facade. These messages are logged at the `INFO` level and contain the `ACCESS_LOG`
marker which you can use to separate standard messages from access log messages.

Access log messages can be further categorized using `UNDERTOW_ACCESS_LOG` and `GRPC_ACCESS_LOG` markers. This is because
evitaDB uses [Undertow](https://undertow.io/) web server for REST and GraphQL APIs and separate web server
for [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). It might be sometimes useful to log these separately because even though they both
use the same log format, for example, gRPC doesn't support all properties as Undertow.

### Server Logback utilities

evitaDB server comes ready with several custom utilities for easier configuration of the custom logged data.

*Note:* These utilities are only available in evitaDB server because the rest of the evitaDB codebase
doesn't rely on a concrete implementation of the [Slf4j](https://www.slf4j.org/) logging facade.
If the evitaDB is used as embedded instance, the following tools are not available, but can be used as reference to 
custom implementation in chosen framework.

#### Log filters

The basic utilities are two [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) filters ready-to-use to easily separate access log messages
from app log messages.

There is `io.evitadb.server.log.AccessLogFilter` filter to only log access log messages.
This filter can be used as follows:
```xml
<appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
    <filter class="io.evitadb.server.log.AccessLogFilter"/>
    <file>/path/to/access.log</file>
    <encoder>
        <pattern>%msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
</appender>
```

There is also `io.evitadb.server.log.AppLogFilter` filter to only log standard log messages.
This filter can be used as follows:
```xml
<appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
    <filter class="io.evitadb.server.log.AppLogFilter"/>
    <file>/evita/logs/evita_server.log</file>
    <encoder>
        <pattern>%date %level [%thread] %logger{10} [%file:%line] -%kvp- %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
</appender>
```
This filter exists because when you enable access logs the log messages with the `ACCESS_LOG` marker aren't filtered out
by default.

#### Tooling for log aggregators

If a log aggregator is used to consume evitaDB log messages, it is often useful to app log messages as one-line JSON objects.
Therefore, there is [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) layout ready-to-use to easily log app log messages as JSON objects.
This layout logs messages as JSON objects and makes sure that everything is properly escaped, even newline characters
in log messages (e.g. stack traces).

The layout is the `io.evitadb.server.log.AppLogJsonLayout` layout to log app log messages, and can be used as follows:
```xml
<configuration>
    <!-- ... -->
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <target>System.out</target>
        <filter class="io.evitadb.server.log.AppLogFilter" />
        <filter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.filter.ThresholdFilter">
            <level>INFO</level>
        </filter>
        <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">
            <layout class="io.evitadb.server.log.AppLogJsonLayout"/>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    <!-- ... -->
</configuration>
```

## Client and request identification

In order to monitor which requests each client executes against evitaDB, each client and each request can be identified by
a unique identifier. In this way, evitaDB calls can be grouped by requests and clients. This may be useful, for example, 
to see if a particular client is executing queries optimally and not creating unnecessary duplicate queries.

Both identifiers are provided by the client itself. The client identifier is expected to be a constant for a particular
client, e.g. `Next.js application`, and will group together all calls to a evitaDB from this client.
The request identifier is expected to be a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
but can be any string value, and will group together all evitaDB calls with this request identifier for a particular client. 
The request definition (what a request identifier represents) is up to the client to decide, for example, a single request 
for JavaScript client may group together all evitaDB calls for a single page render.

### Configuration

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql">

This mechanism is not part of an evitaQL language. Check documentation for your specific client for more information.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="java">

If you are using the Java remote client, you are suggested to provide the `clientId` in
<SourceClass>evita_external_api/evita_external_api_grpc/client/src/main/java/io/evitadb/driver/config/EvitaClientConfiguration.java</SourceClass>
for all requests. The `requestId` is then provided by wrapping your code in a lambda passed to `executeWithRequestId`
method on <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/EvitaSessionContract.java</SourceClass> interface.

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly local>

[Provide the client and request ids to the server](/documentation/user/en/operate/example/call-server-with-ids.java)
</SourceCodeTabs>

If you use embedded variant of evitaDB server there is no sense to provide `clientId` since there is only one client.
The `requestId` is then provided the same way as described above.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="graphql">

To pass the request identification using GraphQL API, our GraphQL API utilizes [GraphQL extensions](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md#request-parameters).
Therefore, to pass request identification information to the evitaDB, pass the following JSON object within the `extensions`
property of a GraphQL request:

```json
"clientContext": {
  "clientId": "Next.js application",
  "requestId": "05e620b2-5b40-4932-b585-bf3bb6bde4b3"
}
```

Both identifiers are optional.

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="rest">

In order to pass request identification using REST API, our REST API utilizes [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).
Therefore, to pass request identification information to the evitaDB, pass the following HTTP headers:

```
X-EvitaDB-ClientID: Next.js application
X-EvitaDB-RequestID: 05e620b2-5b40-4932-b585-bf3bb6bde4b3
```

Both headers are optional.

</LanguageSpecific>

### Logging

These identifiers can be also used to group application log messages by clients and requests for easier debugging of
errors that happened during a specific request. This is done using [MDC](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc)
support. evitaDB passes the client and request identifiers to the MDC context under `clientId` and `requestId` names.

The specific usage depends on the used implementation of the [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) logging facade. For example
in [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/index.html) this can be done using `%X{clientId}` and `%X{requestId}` patterns in the log pattern:
```xml
<encoder>
    <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{10} C:%X{clientId} R:%X{requestId} - %msg%n</pattern>
</encoder>
```
