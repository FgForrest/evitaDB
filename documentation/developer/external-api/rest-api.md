# REST API

evitaDB's REST API is dynamically built based on evitaDB's internal data schemas, thus REST API schema of different
catalogs can be quite different. This way was chosen to simplify life for end-users as much as possible by providing
API specific to their domains. This helps with intuitiveness and fewer errors.

For general overview of REST API principles, read the [user documentation](../../user/en/use/connectors/rest.md).
