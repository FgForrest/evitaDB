/**
 * The constraint `excluding` is a constraint that can only be used within {@link HierarchyWithin} or
 * {@link HierarchyWithinRoot} parent constraints. It simply makes no sense anywhere else because it changes the default
 * behavior of those constraints. Hierarchy constraints return all hierarchy children of the parent node or entities
 * that are transitively or directly related to them, and the parent node itself.
 *
 * The excluding constraint allows you to exclude one or more subtrees from the scope of the filter. This constraint is
 * the exact opposite of the having constraint. If the constraint is true for a hierarchy entity, it and all of its
 * children are excluded from the query. The excluding constraint is the same as declaring `having(not(expression))`,
 * but for the sake of readability it has its own constraint.
 *
 * The constraint accepts following arguments:
 *
 * - one or more mandatory constraints that must be satisfied by all returned hierarchy nodes and that mark the visible
 *   part of the tree, the implicit relation between constraints is logical conjunction (boolean AND)
 *
 * When the hierarchy constraint targets the hierarchy entity, the children that satisfy the inner constraints (and
 * their children, whether they satisfy them or not) are excluded from the result.
 *
 * For demonstration purposes, let's list all categories within the Accessories category, but exclude exactly
 * the Wireless headphones subcategory.
 *
 * <pre>
 * query(
 *     collection("Product"),
 *     filterBy(
 *         hierarchyWithin(
 *             "categories",
 *             attributeEquals("code", "accessories"),
 *             excluding(
 *                 attributeEquals("code", "wireless-headphones")
 *             )
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     require(
 *         entityFetch(
 *             attributeContent("code")
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * The category Wireless Headphones and all its subcategories will not be shown in the results list.
 *
 * If the hierarchy constraint targets a non-hierarchical entity that references the hierarchical one (typical example
 * is a product assigned to a category), the excluding constraint is evaluated against the hierarchical entity
 * (category), but affects the queried non-hierarchical entities (products). It excludes all products referencing
 * categories that satisfy the excluding inner constraints.
 *
 * Let's go back to our example query that excludes the Wireless Headphones category subtree. To list all products
 * available in the Accessories category except those related to the Wireless Headphones category or its subcategories,
 * issue the following query:
 *
 * <pre>
 * query(
 *     collection("Product"),
 *     filterBy(
 *         hierarchyWithin(
 *             "categories",
 *             attributeEquals("code", "accessories"),
 *             excluding(
 *                 attributeEquals("code", "wireless-headphones")
 *             )
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     require(
 *         entityFetch(
 *             attributeContent("code")
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can see that wireless headphone products like Huawei FreeBuds 4, Jabra Elite 3 or Adidas FWD-02 Sport are not
 * present in the listing.
 *
 * When the product is assigned to two categories - one excluded and one part of the visible category tree, the product
 * remains in the result. See the example.
 *
 * <strong>The lookup stops at the first node that satisfies the constraint!</strong>
 *
 * The hierarchical query traverses from the root nodes to the leaf nodes. For each of the nodes, the engine checks
 * whether the excluding constraint is satisfied valid, and if so, it excludes that hierarchy node and all of its child
 * nodes (entire subtree).
