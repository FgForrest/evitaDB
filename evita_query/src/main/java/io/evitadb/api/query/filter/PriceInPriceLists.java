/**
 * The `priceInPriceLists` constraint defines the allowed set(s) of price lists that the entity must have to be included
 * in the result set. The order of the price lists in the argument is important for the final price for sale calculation
 * - see the <a href="https://evitadb.io/documentation/deep-dive/price-for-sale-calculation">price for sale calculation
 * algorithm documentation</a>. Price list names are represented by plain String and are case-sensitive. Price lists
 * don't have to be stored in the database as an entity, and if they are, they are not currently associated with
 * the price list code defined in the prices of other entities. The pricing structure is simple and flat for now
 * (but this may change in the future).
 *
 * Except for the <a href="https://evitadb.io/documentation/query/filtering/price?lang=evitaql#typical-usage-of-price-constraints">standard use-case</a>
 * you can also create query with this constraint only:
 *
 * <pre>
 * priceInPriceLists(
 *     "vip-group-1-level",
 *     "vip-group-2-level",
 *     "vip-group-3-level"
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Warning: Only a single occurrence of any of this constraint is allowed in the filter part of the query.
 * Currently, there is no way to switch context between different parts of the filter and build queries such as find
 * a product whose price is either in "CZK" or "EUR" currency at this or that time using this constraint.
