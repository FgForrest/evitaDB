/**
 * This `orderBy` is container for ordering. It is mandatory container when any ordering is to be used.
 * evitaDB requires a previously prepared sort index to be able to sort entities. This fact makes sorting much faster
 * than ad-hoc sorting by attribute value. Also, the sorting mechanism of evitaDB is somewhat different from what you
 * might be used to. If you sort entities by two attributes in an orderBy clause of the query, evitaDB sorts them first
 * by the first attribute (if present) and then by the second (but only those where the first attribute is missing).
 * If two entities have the same value of the first attribute, they are not sorted by the second attribute, but by the
 * primary key (in ascending order). If we want to use fast "pre-sorted" indexes, there is no other way to do it,
 * because the secondary order would not be known until a query time.
 *
 * This default sorting behavior by multiple attributes is not always desirable, so evitaDB allows you to define
 * a sortable attribute compound, which is a virtual attribute composed of the values of several other attributes.
 * evitaDB also allows you to specify the order of the "pre-sorting" behavior (ascending/descending) for each of these
 * attributes, and also the behavior for NULL values (first/last) if the attribute is completely missing in the entity.
 * The sortable attribute compound is then used in the orderBy clause of the query instead of specifying the multiple
 * individual attributes to achieve the expected sorting behavior while maintaining the speed of the "pre-sorted"
 * indexes.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * orderBy(
 *     ascending("code"),
 *     ascending("create"),
 *     priceDescending()
 * )
 * </pre>
