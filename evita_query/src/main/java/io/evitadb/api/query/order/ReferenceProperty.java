/**
 * Sorting by reference attribute is not as common as sorting by entity attributes, but it allows you to sort entities
 * that are in a particular category or have a particular brand specifically by the priority/order for that particular
 * relationship.
 *
 * To sort products related to a "Sony" brand by the `priority` attribute set on the reference, you need to use the
 * following constraint:
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * query(
 *     collection("Product"),
 *     filterBy(
 *         referenceHaving(
 *             "brand",
 *             entityHaving(
 *                 attributeEquals("code","sony")
 *             )
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     orderBy(
 *         referenceProperty(
 *             "brand",
 *             attributeNatural("orderInBrand", ASC)
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     require(
 *         entityFetch(
 *             attributeContent("code"),
 *             referenceContentWithAttributes(
 *                 "brand",
 *                 attributeContent("orderInBrand")
 *             )
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * **The `referenceProperty` is implicit in requirement `referenceContent`**
 *
 * In the `orderBy` clause within the {@link io.evitadb.api.query.require.ReferenceContent} requirement,
 * the `referenceProperty` constraint is implicit and must not be repeated. All attribute order constraints
 * in `referenceContent` automatically refer to the reference attributes, unless the {@link EntityProperty} or
 * {@link EntityGroupProperty} container is used there.
 *
 * The example is based on a simple one-to-zero-or-one reference (a product can have at most one reference to a brand
 * entity). The response will only return the products that have a reference to the "Sony" brand, all of which contain the
 * `orderInBrand` attribute (since it's marked as a non-nullable attribute). Because the example is so simple, the returned
 * result can be anticipated.
 *
 * ## Behaviour of zero or one to many references ordering
 *
 * The situation is more complicated when the reference is one-to-many. What is the expected result of a query that
 * involves ordering by a property on a reference attribute? Is it wise to allow such ordering query in this case?
 *
 * We decided to allow it and bind it with the following rules:
 *
 * ### Non-hierarchical entity
 *
 * If the referenced entity is **non-hierarchical**, and the returned entity references multiple entities, only
 * the reference with the lowest primary key of the referenced entity, while also having the order property set, will be
 * used for ordering.
 *
 * ### Hierarchical entity
 *
 * If the referenced entity is **hierarchical** and the returned entity references multiple entities, the reference used
 * for ordering is the one that contains the order property and is the closest hierarchy node to the root of the filtered
 * hierarchy node.
 *
 * It sounds complicated, but it's really quite simple. If you list products of a certain category and at the same time
 * order them by a property "priority" set on the reference to the category, the first products will be those directly
 * related to the category, ordered by "priority", followed by the products of the first child category, and so on,
 * maintaining the depth-first order of the category tree.
