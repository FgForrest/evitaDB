/**
 * The constraint `having` is a constraint that can only be used within {@link HierarchyWithin} or
 * {@link HierarchyWithinRoot} parent constraints. It simply makes no sense anywhere else because it changes the default
 * behavior of those constraints. Hierarchy constraints return all hierarchy children of the parent node or entities
 * that are transitively or directly related to them, and the parent node itself.
 *
 * The having constraint allows you to set a constraint that must be fulfilled by all categories in the category scope
 * in order to be accepted by hierarchy within filter. This constraint is especially useful if you want to conditionally
 * display certain parts of the tree. Imagine you have a category Christmas Sale that should only be available during
 * a certain period of the year, or a category B2B Partners that should only be accessible to a certain role of users.
 * All of these scenarios can take advantage of the having constraint (but there are other approaches to solving
 * the above use cases).
 *
 * The constraint accepts following arguments:
 *
 * - one or more mandatory constraints that must be satisfied by all returned hierarchy nodes and that mark the visible
 *   part of the tree, the implicit relation between constraints is logical conjunction (boolean AND)
 *
 * When the hierarchy constraint targets the hierarchy entity, the children that don't satisfy the inner constraints
 * (and their children, whether they satisfy them or not) are excluded from the result.
 *
 * For demonstration purposes, let's list all categories within the Accessories category, but only those that are valid
 * at 01:00 AM on October 1, 2023.
 *
 * <pre>
 * query(
 *     collection('Category'),
 *     filterBy(
 *         hierarchyWithinSelf(
 *             attributeEquals('code', 'accessories'),
 *             having(
 *                 or(
 *                     attributeIsNull('validity'),
 *                     attributeInRange('validity', 2023-10-01T01:00:00-01:00)
 *                 )
 *             )
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     require(
 *         entityFetch(
 *             attributeContent('code')
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Because the category Christmas electronics has its validity set to be valid only between December 1st and December
 * 24th, it will be omitted from the result. If it had subcategories, they would also be omitted (even if they had no
 * validity restrictions).
 *
 * If the hierarchy constraint targets a non-hierarchical entity that references the hierarchical one (typical example
 * is a product assigned to a category), the having constraint is evaluated against the hierarchical entity (category),
 * but affects the queried non-hierarchical entities (products). It excludes all products referencing categories that
 * don't satisfy the having inner constraints.
 *
 * Let's use again our example with Christmas electronics that is valid only between 1st and 24th December. To list all
 * products available at 01:00 AM on October 1, 2023, issue a following query:
 *
 * <pre>
 * query(
 *     collection("Product"),
 *     filterBy(
 *         hierarchyWithin(
 *             "categories",
 *             attributeEquals("code", "accessories"),
 *             having(
 *                 or(
 *                     attributeIsNull("validity"),
 *                     attributeInRange("validity", 2023-10-01T01:00:00-01:00)
 *                 )
 *             )
 *         )
 *     ),
 *     require(
 *         entityFetch(
 *             attributeContent("code")
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can see that Christmas products like Retlux Blue Christmas lightning, Retlux Warm white Christmas lightning or
 * Emos Candlestick are not present in the listing.
 *
 * <strong>The lookup stops at the first node that doesn't satisfy the constraint!</strong>
 *
 * The hierarchical query traverses from the root nodes to the leaf nodes. For each of the nodes, the engine checks
 * whether the having constraint is still valid, and if not, it excludes that hierarchy node and all of its child nodes
 * (entire subtree).
 *
 * <strong>What if the product is linked to two categories - one that meets the constraint and one that does not?</strong>
 *
 * In the situation where the single product, let's say Garmin Vivosmart 5, is in both the excluded category Christmas
 * Electronics and the included category Smartwatches, it will remain in the query result because there is at least one
 * product reference that is part of the visible part of the tree.
