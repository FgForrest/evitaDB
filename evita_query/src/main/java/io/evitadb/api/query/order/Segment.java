/**
 * The `segments` allows to define multiple ordering styles in one query. Segments take the produced filtered result and
 * sort it by the order clauses defined within particular segment and extract specified number of entities from
 * the sorted output. The extracted entities are then excluded from the original result and the process is repeated
 * with the next segment until all segments are processed. If there are any entities left in the original result,
 * they are appended to the final result in the order or the primary key (ascending).
 *
 * Segments also allow to define a filtering constraint that selects only entities that are to be processed / ordered
 * by the particular segment (similar to sub-select in relational algebra except it doesn't affect the set of returned
 * result but rather their order limited to this segment).
 *
 * When segment doesn't define limit it means all entities matching the filter constraint are processed by the segment.
 * If no filter constraint is defined for the segment, all entities are processed - and if there is another segment
 * defined after this one, it will never be reached.
 *
 * Segments are not the same as multiple order clauses in the `orderBy` constraint - multiple order clauses define
 * primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. sorting order for the whole result set. Segments define multiple separate sorting
 * orders for different parts of the result set.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * orderBy(
 *    segment(
 *       orderBy(
 *          attributeNatural("orderedQuantity, DESC)
 *       ),
 *       limit(3)
 *    ),
 *    segment(
 *       filterBy(
 *          attributeEquals("new", true)
 *       ),
 *       orderBy(
 *          random()
 *       ),
 *       limit(2)
 *    ),
 *    segment(
 *       orderBy(
 *          ascending("code"),
 *          ascending("create")
 *       )
 *    )
 * )
 * </pre>
