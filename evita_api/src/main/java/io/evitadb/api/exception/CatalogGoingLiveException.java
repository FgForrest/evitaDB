/**
 * Exception thrown when an attempt is made to access a catalog that is currently transitioning from warm-up state to live state.
 * This typically occurs during catalog initialization or recovery processes. The operation should be retried after the transition
 * is complete.
 *
 * This exception extends {@link EvitaInvalidUsageException} and is thrown to indicate a temporary unavailability of the catalog
 * rather than a permanent error condition.
