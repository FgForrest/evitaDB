/**
 * GoLiveProgress is an interface that represents the progress of a catalog go-live operation in a database.
 * The go-live operation switches a catalog from warm-up mode to transactional mode. It provides a way to track
 * the completion status and percentage of this operation.
 *
 * The interface provides the following guarantees:
 *
 * 1. the operation must eventually complete (either successfully or exceptionally)
 * 2. the percentage completion is monotonically increasing from 0 to 100
 * 3. once the operation completes successfully, the catalog is available for transactional operations
 * 4. if the operation completes exceptionally, the catalog remains in its previous state
 * 5. the completion stage allows asynchronous waiting for the operation to finish
