/**
 * This is the definition object for {@link Reference} that is stored along with
 * {@link Entity}. Definition objects allow to describe the structure of the entity type so that
 * in any time everyone can consult complete structure of the entity type. Definition object is similar to Java reflection
 * process where you can also at any moment see which fields and methods are available for the class.
 *
 * The references refer to other entities (of same or different entity type).
 * Allows entity filtering (but not sorting) of the entities by using {@link FacetHaving} query
 * and statistics computation if when {@link FacetStatistics} requirement is used. Reference
 * is uniquely represented by int positive number (max. 2<sup>63</sup>-1) and {@link Serializable} entity type and can be
 * part of multiple reference groups, that are also represented by int and {@link Serializable} entity type.
 *
 * Reference id in one entity is unique and belongs to single reference group id. Among multiple entities reference may be part
 * of different reference groups. Referenced entity type may represent type of another Evita entity or may refer
 * to anything unknown to Evita that posses unique int key and is maintained by external systems (fe. tag assignment,
 * group assignment, category assignment, stock assignment and so on). Not all these data needs to be present in
 * Evita.
 *
 * References may carry additional key-value data linked to this entity relation (fe. item count present on certain stock).
 * The search query must contain specific {@link ReferenceContent} requirement in order references are fetched along with
 * the entity.
