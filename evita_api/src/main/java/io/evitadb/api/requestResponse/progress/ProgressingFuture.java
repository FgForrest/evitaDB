/**
 * A specialized {@link CompletableFuture} that provides progress tracking capabilities for long-running operations.
 * This class extends the standard CompletableFuture to support hierarchical progress reporting through nested futures
 * and allows consumers to monitor the completion status of complex asynchronous operations.
 *
 * <p>The ProgressingFuture supports two main usage patterns:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Simple execution:</strong> Execute a single supplier with progress tracking</li>
 *   <li><strong>Nested execution:</strong> Coordinate multiple nested futures and aggregate their progress</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Progress is reported through a {@link BiIntConsumer} that receives the current number of completed steps
 * and the total number of steps. The progress consumer is called whenever progress is updated, either directly
 * through {@link #updateProgress(int)} or indirectly through nested future completion.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example usage with simple execution:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ProgressingFuture<String, Void> future = new ProgressingFuture<>(
 *     100, // total steps
 *     (stepsDone, totalSteps) -> System.out.println("Progress: " + stepsDone + "/" + totalSteps),
 *     () -> {
 *         // Perform work and call updateProgress as needed
 *         return "Result";
 *     },
 *     executor
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example usage with nested futures:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ProgressingFuture<List<String>, String> future = new ProgressingFuture<>(
 *     10, // additional steps for this level
 *     (stepsDone, totalSteps) -> System.out.println("Overall progress: " + stepsDone + "/" + totalSteps),
 *     nestedFutureFactories, // Collection of functions that create nested ProgressingFutures
 *     (progress, results) -> results, // Result mapper
 *     executor
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The class automatically handles progress aggregation from nested futures, ensuring that the total progress
 * reflects the completion status of all nested operations. When the future completes (either successfully or
 * exceptionally), the progress is automatically set to the total number of steps.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the result produced by this future
