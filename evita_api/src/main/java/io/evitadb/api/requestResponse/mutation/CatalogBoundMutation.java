/**
 * This interface represents mutations that are bound to a specific catalog within the evitaDB instance.
 *
 * CatalogBoundMutation is a sealed interface that permits three specific types of mutations:
 *
 * 1. **EntityMutation**: Top-level mutations that group all LocalMutations targeting the same entity,
 *    allowing for atomic updates to a single Entity in evitaDB.
 *
 * 2. **LocalMutation**: Mutations that operate on an EntityContract object.
 *
 * 3. **SchemaMutation**: Mutations that operate on an EntitySchemaContract object, allowing for
 *    schema modifications that happen transactionally.
 *
 * Unlike EngineMutation which operates on the entire evitaDB instance, CatalogBoundMutation is
 * scoped to a specific catalog, providing more targeted mutation capabilities.
 *
 * All implementations must provide a way to transform the mutation to a stream of change catalog
 * capture items for tracking and auditing purposes.
