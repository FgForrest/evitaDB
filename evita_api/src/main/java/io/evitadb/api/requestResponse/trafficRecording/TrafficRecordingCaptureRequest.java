/**
 * Traffic recording capture request is used to specify the criteria for retrieving contents from the traffic recording
 * log.
 *
 * @param content determines whether only basic information about the traffic recording is returned or the actual content
 * @param since specifies the time from which the traffic recording should be returned
 * @param sinceSessionSequenceId specifies the session sequence ID from which the traffic recording should be returned
 * @param sinceRecordSessionOffset specifies the record session offset from which the traffic recording should be returned
 *                                 (the offset is relative to the session sequence ID and starts from 0), offset allows
 *                                 to continue fetching the traffic recording from the last fetched record when session
 *                                 was not fully fetched
 * @param type specifies the types of traffic recording to be returned
 * @param sessionId specifies the session ID from which the traffic recording should be returned
 * @param longerThan specifies the minimum duration of the traffic recording to be returned
 * @param fetchingMoreBytesThan specifies the minimum number of bytes that the traffic recording should contain
