/**
 * Price inner record handling controls how prices that share same `inner entity id` will behave during filtering and sorting.
 * It can be one of the following behaviours:
 *
 * - FIRST_OCCURRENCE: prices with same inner entity id will be sorted descending by priority value and first one
 *   (i.e. the one with the biggest priority) will be used (others won't be considered at all)
 * - SUM: prices with same inner entity id will be added up to a new computed aggregated price, prices must share same
 *   tax rate percentage, currency and price list id in order to be added up
