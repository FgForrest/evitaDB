/**
 * Implementations of this interface signalize that they might conflict with other {@link CatalogSchemaMutation} in
 * the pipeline. Method {@link #combineWith(CatalogSchemaContract, CatalogSchemaMutation)} allows to examine each
 * of the pipeline mutation and react to it.
 *
 * The interface was created mainly for the needs of {@link CatalogSchemaEditor.CatalogSchemaBuilder} where it's in our
 * interest to create the least amount of schema mutations possible. Most of the schema mutation are usually quite
 * expensive on larger databases and if there is chance to avoid those, we should try to do that. Consider situation
 * when the client calls operations like `attribute` -> `not filterable`, `attribute` -> filterable by accident.
 * Should we drop laboriously built index on such attribute just to create it again from the scratch or should we
 * eliminate the opposite commands on the spot?! We chose the latter - the builder produces only the minimal set of
 * necessary changes.
