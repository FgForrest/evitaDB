/**
 * Progress is a generic interface that represents the progress of an engine mutation operation.
 * It provides a way to track the completion status and percentage of long-running operations.
 *
 * The interface provides the following guarantees:
 *
 * 1. the operation must eventually complete (either successfully or exceptionally)
 * 2. the percentage completion is monotonically increasing from 0 to 100
 * 3. once the operation completes successfully, the result is available through the completion stage
 * 4. if the operation completes exceptionally, the system remains in its previous state
 * 5. the completion stage allows asynchronous waiting for the operation to finish
 *
 * @param <T> the type of result returned when the operation completes successfully
