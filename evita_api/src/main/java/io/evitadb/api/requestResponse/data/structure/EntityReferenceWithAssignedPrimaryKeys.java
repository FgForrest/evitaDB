/**
 * Extended entity reference that maintains a mapping of reassigned primary keys for entity references.
 * This class is used during entity mutations when references need to be tracked with their newly assigned
 * internal primary keys after persistence.
 *
 * <p>When references are first created, they are assigned temporary negative internal primary keys.
 * Upon persistence to the database, these temporary keys are replaced with positive permanent internal
 * primary keys assigned by the server. This class maintains the mapping between the original reference
 * keys (with temporary internal PKs) and the reference keys with their newly assigned permanent internal PKs.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful in scenarios where:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Multiple references share the same business key but differ in properties</li>
 *     <li>Client code needs to track which references were assigned which internal primary keys after persistence</li>
 *     <li>References need to be looked up by their original temporary keys to find their permanent counterparts</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Class is immutable and thread-safe - it supports caching entities in a shared cache accessed by many threads.</p>
 *
 * @param type                      Reference to {@link Entity#getType()} of the referenced entity. Might be also any {@link String}
 *                                  that identifies a type of some external resource not maintained by Evita.
 * @param primaryKey                Reference to {@link Entity#getPrimaryKey()} of the referenced entity. Might be also any integer
 *                                  that uniquely identifies some external resource of type {@link #getType()} not maintained by Evita.
 * @param reassignedReferenceKeys   Mapping from original {@link ReferenceKey} (with temporary internal PK) to the new
 *                                  {@link ReferenceKey} with permanent internal PK assigned by the server after persistence.
 *                                  The map uses {@link ComparableReferenceKey} as keys for efficient lookup and comparison.
