/**
 * Schema allows to set up bi-directional relation between two entities. By default, all properties and reference
 * attributes of the reflected reference are inherited from the target reference. This can be changed by setting
 * appropriate properties on the reflected reference schema definition, however. You'd probably want to alter
 * the original {@link ReferenceSchemaContract#getCardinality()} as it may not be the same for the reflected reference.
 *
 * Reflected reference behaves the same as normal reference - it can be created, updated or deleted both from the source
 * and target entity. It always modifies data in the source entity (entity that maintains the primary reference), but
 * updates all the involved indexes so that the data remains consistent from both sides.
 *
 * Note: the original reference {@link ReferenceSchemaContract#getReferencedEntityType()} must target the entity where
 * the reflected reference is defined, also the {@link ReferenceSchemaContract#isReferencedEntityTypeManaged()} must be
 * set to true.
