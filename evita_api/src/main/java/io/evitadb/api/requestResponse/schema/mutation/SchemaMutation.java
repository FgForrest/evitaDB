/**
 * Entity {@link Mutation} allows to execute mutation operations on {@link EntitySchemaContract} object itself.
 * Each change increments {@link EntitySchemaContract#version()} by one.
 *
 * These traits should help to manage concurrent transactional process as updates to the same entity could be executed
 * safely and concurrently as long as schema modification doesn't overlap. Modification alters only the schema model,
 * but mutation application on the engine side have side effects such as index creation or removal. Schema mutations
 * happen transactionally - either completely or not at all.
