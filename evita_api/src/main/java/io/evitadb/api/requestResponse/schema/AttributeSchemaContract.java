/**
 * This is the definition object for {@link Attributes} that is stored along with
 * {@link Entity}. Definition objects allow to describe the structure of the entity type so that
 * in any time everyone can consult complete structure of the entity type. Definition object is similar to Java reflection
 * process where you can also at any moment see which fields and methods are available for the class.
 *
 * Entity attributes allows defining set of data that are fetched in bulk along with the entity body.
 * Attributes may be indexed for fast filtering or can be used to sort along. Attributes are not automatically indexed
 * in order not to waste precious memory space for data that will never be used in search queries.
 *
 * Filtering in attributes is executed by using constraints like {@link And}, {@link Or}, {@link Not},
 * {@link AttributeEquals}, {@link AttributeContains} and many others. Sorting can be achieved with
 * {@link AttributeNatural} or others.
 *
 * Attributes are not recommended for bigger data as they are all loaded at once when {@link AttributeContent}
 * requirement is used. Large data that are occasionally used store in {@link AssociatedData}.
