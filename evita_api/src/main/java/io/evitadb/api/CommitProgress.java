/**
 * CommitProgress is an interface that represents the progress of a transaction commit operation in a database. It contains
 * multiple CompletableFuture objects that allow tracking the status of various stages of the commit process. It provides
 * the following guarantees:
 *
 * 1. later stage is not completed before the earlier stage is completed
 * 2. when a stage completes with an exception, all later stages are completed with the same exception immediately after
 * 3. all stages must eventually complete
 * 4. if WAL appending stage completes successfully, the changes are guaranteed to be visible to all readers later;
 * if onChangesVisible completes with exception afterwards, the system will replay the changes or mark a catalog
 * as corrupted (changes might be applied after evita server restart, or the error just might signalize lost connection
 * between the server and client and the server side already applied the changed, but the client couldn't receive
 * acknowledgment)
 * 5. if a session was read-only or didn't make any changes, all stages are completed before the record is created
