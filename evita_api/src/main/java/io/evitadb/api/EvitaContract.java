/**
 * Evita is a specialized database with easy-to-use API for e-commerce systems. Purpose of this research is creating fast
 * and scalable engine that handles all complex tasks that e-commerce systems has to deal with on daily basis. Evita should
 * operate as a fast secondary lookup / search index used by application frontends. We aim for order of magnitude better
 * latency (10x faster or better) for common e-commerce tasks than other solutions based on SQL or NoSQL databases on the
 * same hardware specification. Evita should not be used for storing and handling primary data, and we don't aim for ACID
 * properties nor data corruption guarantees. Evita "index" must be treated as something that could be dropped any time and
 * built up from scratch easily again.
 *
 * This interface represents main entrance to the evitaDB contents.
 * Evita contract is thread safe.
