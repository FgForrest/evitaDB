     * in this state. No transaction are allowed in this state and there are no guarantees on consistency of the catalog
     * if any of the WRITE operations fails. If any error is encountered while writing to the catalog in this state it is
     * strongly recommended discarding entire catalog contents and starts filling it from the scratch.
     *
     * Writing to the catalog in this phase is much faster than with transactional access. Operations are executed in bulk,
     * transactional logic is disabled and doesn't slow down the writing process.
     *
     * This phase is meant to quickly fill initial state of the catalog from the external primary data store.
