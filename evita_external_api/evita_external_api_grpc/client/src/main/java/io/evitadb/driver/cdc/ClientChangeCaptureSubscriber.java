/**
 * Client-side implementation of a subscriber that bridges between gRPC streaming and Java Flow API.
 * This class acts as both a Flow.Subscriber and a ClientResponseObserver, allowing it to:
 *
 * 1. Receive change captures from the server via gRPC streaming
 * 2. Forward these captures to a delegate Flow.Subscriber
 *
 * The subscriber works in conjunction with {@link ClientChangeCapturePublisher} to provide
 * a reactive streaming interface for change data capture events coming from the evitaDB server.
 *
 * This class handles the lifecycle of the subscription, including error handling and graceful
 * shutdown when the client or server closes the connection.
 *
 * @param <C> type of change capture that this subscriber handles
 * @param <REQ> type of request sent to the server
 * @param <RES> type of response received from the server
