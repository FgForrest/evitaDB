/**
 * Exception thrown when a client consuming the Change Data Capture (CDC) stream cannot process
 * the incoming changes fast enough to keep up with the server's data flow rate.
 *
 * When this exception occurs, the CDC stream is terminated to prevent resource exhaustion.
 * The client application needs to create a new CDC stream connection, starting from the
 * version and index values provided in this exception to continue capturing changes
 * without missing any data.
 *
 * The `version` represents the transaction version number, and the `index` represents
 * the position within that transaction's change set where the client should resume.
