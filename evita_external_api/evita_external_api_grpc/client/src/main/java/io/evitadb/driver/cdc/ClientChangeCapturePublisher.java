/**
 * Client-side implementation of {@link ChangeCapturePublisher} that is used to publish {@link ChangeCapture}s
 * received from the server using gRPC streaming. This publisher acts as a bridge between the gRPC streaming API
 * and the Java Flow API.
 *
 * The publisher maintains a collection of subscriptions and delegates received captures to all active subscribers.
 * It supports multiple concurrent subscribers and ensures that each subscriber receives the captures it has requested.
 *
 * The publisher uses a queue-based approach to buffer captures for each subscriber, allowing subscribers to consume
 * captures at their own pace. If a subscriber cannot keep up with the rate of incoming captures (queue becomes full),
 * an error is reported to that subscriber.
