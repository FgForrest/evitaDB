   * Entities may be organized in hierarchical fashion. That means that entity may refer to single parent entity and may be
   * referred by multiple child entities. Hierarchy is always composed of entities of same type.
   * Each entity must be part of at most single hierarchy (tree).
   * Hierarchy can limit returned entities by using filtering constraints `hierarchy_{reference name}_within`. It's also used for
