 * This observable input extends original Kryo {@link Input} allowing to automatically verify CRC32C checksums after
 * record has been read from the storage. It also verifies whether the read record size match expected record size
 * stored along with the record.
 *
 * When {@link ObservableInput} is initialized with {@link RandomAccessFileInputStream} it can perform {@link #seek(FileLocation)}
 * operation that allows it to skim through random record locations of the file and read records one by one. Reading
 * buffer size is automatically adapted to expected record size SSD page size is effectively used (see

 * Use {@link ObservableInput#ObservableInput(InputStream)} method to use recommended settings for SSD drives.
