/**
 * This observable output extends original Kryo {@link Output} allowing to automatically compute CRC32C checksums after
 * record has been written to the storage. It also collects the written record size automatically and writes it to the
 * specified position in the record. To avoid writing to already committed file page the record flushing is postponed
 * until entire record has been written and record length update is performed in not yet stored buffer in the memory.
 * This also means that entire record must fit in the `bufferSize` size that defined in the constructor of this class.
 *
 * Because we need sufficiently big `buffer` because it limits our record sizes we need to specify another `flushSize`
 * limit that will control what size of "finalized" content (i.e. records which writing has been finished) will be flushed
 * to the disk. This means that even if we have very large buffer (say 16MB) and we write lot of small records (say 2KB)
 * we well be able to flush these records each 8KB (i.e. `flushSize=8KB`).
