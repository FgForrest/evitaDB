/**
 * OffHeapMemoryOutputStream is a class that allows writing data to off-heap memory.
 * It provides an OutputStream implementation that writes to a ByteBuffer.
 * Only one instance of OffHeapMemoryOutputStream can be created for a specific buffer.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Create a ByteBuffer to be used as the buffer for the output stream.
 * 2. Create a BiConsumer that will be executed when the output stream is closed.
 * 3. Initialize the OffHeapMemoryOutputStream by calling the init() method, providing the buffer and finalizer.
 * 4. Use the write() methods to write data to the output stream.
 * 5. Call the getInputStream() method to get an associated OffHeapMemoryInputStream for reading the data.
 * 6. Call the close() method to close either the output or the input stream and execute the finalizer.
 *
 * Note: The OffHeapMemoryOutputStream is not thread-safe, but the associated OffHeapMemoryInputStream is also not
 * thread-safe, so the usage should be synchronized externally if necessary.
