 * This test verifies the contract of {@link MutationReaderPublisher} and its ability to publish mutation events.

 * <ul>
 *   <li>Publishing all mutations from the beginning</li>
 *   <li>Publishing mutations from a specific version</li>
 *   <li>Publishing mutations within a version range</li>
 *   <li>Handling subscriber saturation (when subscriber can't keep up with the publisher)</li>
 *   <li>Consuming new versions as they are introduced to the WAL</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The tests use a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to store mutations and verify that the publisher correctly
 * reads and publishes these mutations to subscribers following the Reactive Streams pattern.
