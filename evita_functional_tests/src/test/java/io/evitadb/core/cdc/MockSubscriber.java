 * A test implementation of {@link Subscriber} that collects received items and provides

 * 1. Subscribe to a CapturePublisher and collect the items it publishes
 * 2. Complete a future when a specified number of items have been received
 * 3. Track errors and completion signals
 * 4. Provide mechanisms to wait for errors or completion signals
 *
 * The subscriber implements a simple flow control strategy by requesting one item at a time,
 * which allows testing backpressure handling in the publisher.
